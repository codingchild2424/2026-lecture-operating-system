# Week 03 — Process 2

## Overview
- **Textbook**: Silberschatz Ch 2 (OS Structures), Ch 3 (Processes) advanced
- **xv6 Reference**: Ch 2 (OS Organization), Ch 4.1–4.4 (Traps and System Calls)
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Compare OS structures (Monolithic, Microkernel, Hybrid)
  - Understand the Trap/System Call flow
  - Trace the syscall path in xv6 source code
