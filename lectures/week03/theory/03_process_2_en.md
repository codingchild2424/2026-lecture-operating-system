# Part 1
## Interprocess Communication (IPC)
### Silberschatz Ch 3.4

# Independent vs Cooperating Processes

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Processes executing concurrently in an operating system fall into two categories:

**Independent process**
- Cannot affect or be affected by the execution of other processes
- Does not share data with other processes

**Cooperating process**
- Can affect or be affected by the execution of other processes
- Any process that shares data with others falls into this category

> Most real-world systems consist of cooperating processes.

</div>

---

# Reasons for Process Cooperation

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Four reasons why cooperating processes are needed:

1. **Information sharing**
   - Multiple processes accessing the same data concurrently (e.g., copy-paste)

2. **Computation speedup**
   - Improve processing speed by executing tasks in parallel
   - Effective on multicore systems

3. **Modularity**
   - Design system functions as separate processes/threads

4. **Convenience**
   - Users perform multiple tasks simultaneously (editing, playing music, web browsing, etc.)

</div>

---

# What is IPC?

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Interprocess Communication (IPC)**
- A mechanism for cooperating processes to exchange data
- "send data to and receive data from each other"

Two fundamental IPC models:

| | Shared Memory | Message Passing |
|---|---|---|
| Method | Read/write to a shared memory region | Send and receive messages |
| Performance | Fast (minimal kernel involvement) | Relatively slow (system calls) |
| Synchronization | Programmer must handle it directly | Managed by the OS |
| Suitable for | Large data exchanges | Small data, distributed systems |

> Most operating systems provide **both** models.

</div>

# Two IPC Models (Figure 3.11)

```

- Shared memory: The kernel only sets up the shared region; subsequent access is normal memory access
- Message passing: The kernel (system calls) is involved in every communication

# Chrome Browser: Multiprocess Architecture

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Chrome is a representative multiprocess architecture utilizing IPC:

- **Browser process** (1) — Manages UI, disk/network I/O
- **Renderer process** (per tab) — Renders web pages (HTML, JS, images)
- **Plug-in process** (per plug-in) — Flash, QuickTime, etc.

Advantages:
- If one website crashes, only that renderer is affected → other tabs continue to work normally
- Renderers run in a **sandbox** → enhanced security
- Processes communicate via IPC

> In single-process browsers, one tab crash would bring down the entire browser.

# Part 2
## Shared-Memory Systems

# Shared-Memory IPC

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

How shared-memory IPC works:

1. Processes that want to communicate **establish a shared memory region**
2. The shared region typically resides in the address space of the creating process
3. Other processes **attach** the shared memory to their own address spaces
4. Data is exchanged through read/write operations

Key characteristics:
- The OS normally **prohibits** inter-process memory access
- To use shared memory, this restriction must be **explicitly removed**
- The format and location of data are **determined by the processes** (the OS is not involved)
- **Synchronization is the programmer's responsibility** (e.g., preventing concurrent writes)

</div>

---

# Producer-Consumer Problem

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A classic paradigm for cooperating processes:

- **Producer** — A process that produces information
- **Consumer** — A process that consumes information

Real-world examples:
- Compiler (producer) → Assembler (consumer)
- Web server (producer) → Web browser (consumer)

Solution: Use a **shared buffer**
- The producer fills the buffer
- The consumer empties the buffer
- The producer and consumer must be **synchronized**

</div>

---

# Two Types of Buffers

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Unbounded buffer**
- No practical limit on buffer size
- Consumer: may wait for new items to arrive
- Producer: can always produce new items

**Bounded buffer**
- Buffer size is **fixed**
- Consumer: waits if the buffer is empty
- Producer: waits if the buffer is full

> In practice, bounded buffers are far more common, and they give rise to synchronization issues.

</div>

---

# Bounded Buffer: Shared Data Structure

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Data shared between Producer and Consumer:

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10

typedef struct {
    /* ... */
} item;

item buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int in = 0;    /* next write position (producer) */
int out = 0;   /* next read position (consumer) */
```

- Implemented as a **circular array** — uses two pointers: in and out
- Buffer empty: `in == out`
- Buffer full: `((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out`
- With this scheme, at most **BUFFER_SIZE - 1** items can be stored

</div>

---

# Bounded Buffer: Producer (Figure 3.12)

<div class="text-left">

```c
item next_produced;

while (true) {
    /* produce an item in next_produced */

    while (((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out)
        ; /* do nothing -- buffer is full, busy waiting */

    buffer[in] = next_produced;
    in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```

How it works:
1. Produce an item
2. **Busy wait** until space becomes available in the buffer
3. Store the item in `buffer[in]`
4. Advance the `in` pointer to the next position (circular)

</div>

---

# Bounded Buffer: Consumer (Figure 3.13)

<div class="text-left">

```c
item next_consumed;

while (true) {
    while (in == out)
        ; /* do nothing -- buffer is empty, busy waiting */

    next_consumed = buffer[out];
    out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;

    /* consume the item in next_consumed */
}
```

How it works:
1. **Busy wait** until an item appears in the buffer
2. Retrieve the item from `buffer[out]`
3. Advance the `out` pointer to the next position (circular)
4. Consume the item

# Part 3
## Message-Passing Systems
### Silberschatz Ch 3.6

---

# Message Passing Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A method for inter-process communication without shared memory

Two basic operations:
- **send(message)** — send a message
- **receive(message)** — receive a message

Characteristics:
- Does not share the same address space
- Particularly useful in **distributed environments** (different computers connected via a network)
- Example: internet chat programs

Three considerations for **logical implementation** of communication links:
1. **Naming** — How do you identify the communication partner?
2. **Synchronization** — Synchronous or asynchronous?
3. **Buffering** — What is the capacity of the message queue?

</div>

---

# Naming: Direct Communication

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Direct Communication** — Explicitly specify the communication partner

Symmetric:
- `send(P, message)` — send a message to process P
- `receive(Q, message)` — receive a message from process Q
- Both sides specify their partner

Asymmetric:
- `send(P, message)` — send to process P
- `receive(id, message)` — receive from any process; id is set to the sender

Properties of direct communication:
- **Exactly one link** exists between each pair of processes
- Links are established **automatically**
- Drawback: if a process identifier changes, all references must be updated → **limits modularity**

</div>

---

# Naming: Indirect Communication

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Indirect Communication** — Exchange messages through a **mailbox (port)**

- `send(A, message)` — send a message to mailbox A
- `receive(A, message)` — receive a message from mailbox A

Properties of indirect communication:
- Two processes must share a **common mailbox** for a link to exist
- A single link can be associated with **two or more** processes
- **Multiple links** can exist between a pair of processes (each through a different mailbox)

Mailbox ownership:
- **Process-owned**: only the owner can receive; mailbox is destroyed when the process terminates
- **OS-owned**: exists independently; the OS provides system calls for creation, deletion, send, and receive

</div>

---

# Naming: Mailbox Multiple Receiver Problem

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

If P1 sends a message to mailbox A, and both P2 and P3 call receive() on A, who gets it?

```text
   P1 ──send(A, msg)──▷ [ Mailbox A ] ◁──receive(A, msg)── P2
                                       ◁──receive(A, msg)── P3
```

Possible solutions:
1. Allow a link to be associated with **at most two processes**
2. Allow only **one process at a time** to execute receive()
3. **The system arbitrarily selects** a receiver (e.g., round robin) and notifies the sender of who received the message

</div>

---

# Synchronization

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

send() and receive() can be either **blocking (synchronous)** or **non-blocking (asynchronous)**:

| Operation | Blocking (Synchronous) | Non-blocking (Asynchronous) |
|---|---|---|
| **send** | Wait until the receiver accepts | Send and proceed immediately |
| **receive** | Wait until a message arrives | Receive if available, otherwise return null |

**Rendezvous**
- Combination of blocking send + blocking receive
- The sender and receiver wait for each other
- The producer-consumer problem becomes trivially solvable

</div>

---

# Rendezvous: Producer-Consumer (Figures 3.14, 3.15)

<div class="text-left">

Implementation using blocking send + blocking receive:

```c
/* Producer */
message next_produced;

while (true) {
    /* produce an item in next_produced */
    send(next_produced);    /* blocking: waits until received */
}
```

```c
/* Consumer */
message next_consumed;

while (true) {
    receive(next_consumed); /* blocking: waits until a message arrives */
    /* consume the item in next_consumed */
}
```

No shared buffer is needed — the OS manages message delivery

</div>

---

# Buffering

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Messages are stored in a **temporary queue** attached to the communication link.

Three approaches based on queue capacity:

**1. Zero capacity** (capacity 0)
- No pending messages in the queue
- The sender **must wait** until the receiver accepts (rendezvous)

**2. Bounded capacity** (finite capacity n)
- Can store at most n messages
- If the queue is not full, the sender proceeds immediately
- If the queue is full, the sender **waits**

**3. Unbounded capacity** (infinite capacity)
- Messages can queue indefinitely
- The sender **never waits**

> Zero capacity = "no buffering" / others = "automatic buffering"

# POSIX Shared Memory

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

POSIX provides a shared memory API based on **memory-mapped files**.

Three-step procedure:

**Step 1: Create a shared memory object**
```c
int fd = shm_open(name, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
```
- `name`: name of the shared memory object (processes access it using the same name)
- `O_CREAT`: create if it does not exist
- `O_RDWR`: allow both reading and writing
- Return value: file descriptor (integer)

**Step 2: Set the size**
```c
ftruncate(fd, 4096);  /* 4096 bytes */
```

**Step 3: Map to the address space**
```c
char *ptr = (char *)mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                          MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
```

</div>

# POSIX Shared Memory — Producer (Figure 3.16)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int main()
{
    const int SIZE = 4096;
    const char *name = "OS";
    const char *message_0 = "Hello";
    const char *message_1 = "World!";

    int fd;
    char *ptr;

    fd = shm_open(name, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
    ftruncate(fd, SIZE);
    ptr = (char *)mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                        MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

    sprintf(ptr, "%s", message_0);
    ptr += strlen(message_0);
    sprintf(ptr, "%s", message_1);
    ptr += strlen(message_1);

    return 0;
}
```

</div>

---

# POSIX Shared Memory — Consumer (Figure 3.17)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

int main()
{
    const int SIZE = 4096;
    const char *name = "OS";

    int fd;
    char *ptr;

    /* Open shared memory (read-only) */
    fd = shm_open(name, O_RDONLY, 0666);

    /* Map to memory */
    ptr = (char *)mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

    /* Read */
    printf("%s", (char *)ptr);

    /* Cleanup: remove shared memory object */
    shm_unlink(name);

    return 0;
}
```

- `shm_unlink()`: removes the shared memory segment
- Compile: `gcc producer.c -o producer -lrt`

</div>

                                        → Outputs "HelloWorld!"
                                             ↓
                                        shm_unlink("OS")
```

- The producer runs first and writes the data
- The consumer opens the shared memory with the same name and reads the data
- The consumer cleans up with `shm_unlink()`

</div>

# Mach Message Passing

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Mach — The microkernel underlying macOS and iOS

Core concept: **Everything is a message**
- Even system calls are implemented as messages
- All communication between processes (tasks) and threads uses message passing

**Port (mailbox)**:
- A message queue with finite capacity
- **Unidirectional** — bidirectional communication requires a separate reply port
- Multiple senders allowed, but **only one receiver**

Special Ports:
- **Task Self port** — used to send messages to the kernel
- **Notify port** — used by the kernel to notify the task of events

</div>

---

# Mach: Port Creation and Message Passing

<div class="text-left text-sm leading-7">

**Port creation:**
```c
mach_port_t port;
mach_port_allocate(
    mach_task_self(),           /* reference to the task itself */
    MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE,    /* receive right */
    &port);                     /* port name */
```

**Message structure:**
- Fixed-size header: message size, source/destination port
- Variable-size body: actual data

**Sending/receiving messages:**
```c
/* Send */
mach_msg(&message.header, MACH_SEND_MSG,
         sizeof(message), 0, MACH_PORT_NULL,
         MACH_MSG_TIMEOUT_NONE, MACH_PORT_NULL);

/* Receive */
mach_msg(&message.header, MACH_RCV_MSG,
         0, sizeof(message), server,
         MACH_MSG_TIMEOUT_NONE, MACH_PORT_NULL);
```

</div>

---

# Mach: When the Queue is Full

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

When a port's message queue is full, the sender has the following options:

1. **Wait indefinitely** — until space becomes available in the queue
2. **Wait at most n milliseconds** — with a timeout
3. **Return immediately** — do not wait
4. **Temporarily cache** — entrust the message to the OS
   - Receive a notification when space becomes available
   - Only one pending message per thread is allowed

Performance optimization:
- Messages within the same system: use **virtual memory mapping**
- Map the sender's address space to the receiver → no actual copy → significant performance improvement

</div>

---

# Windows — ALPC (Advanced Local Procedure Call)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A mechanism for inter-process communication within the same machine on Windows

Port types:
- **Connection port** — published by the server, visible to all processes
- **Communication port** — a dedicated channel after connection

Connection procedure:
1. The client requests a connection to the server's connection port
2. The server creates a **channel** → communication ports for both client and server
3. Bidirectional communication through the channel

Message delivery methods (based on size):
1. **Small messages (<=256 bytes)** — use the port's message queue, delivered by copy
2. **Large messages** — use a **section object** (shared memory)
3. **Very large data** — the server reads/writes directly in the client's address space

</div>

- ALPC is not directly exposed through the Windows API
- Applications use standard RPC, and ALPC handles it internally when on the same system

# Part 5
## Pipes
### Silberschatz Ch 3.7.4

---

# Pipes Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Pipe** = A **conduit** through which two processes can communicate
- One of the oldest IPC mechanisms, present since early UNIX systems

Considerations when implementing pipes:
1. Bidirectional or unidirectional?
2. If bidirectional, half-duplex or full-duplex?
3. Is a parent-child relationship required?
4. Can it communicate over a network?

Two types:
- **Ordinary pipe** — requires parent-child relationship, unidirectional, destroyed when the process terminates
- **Named pipe (FIFO)** — unrelated processes can communicate, bidirectional possible, exists in the file system

</div>

---

# Ordinary Pipes

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Standard producer-consumer pattern:
- The producer writes to the **write end**
- The consumer reads from the **read end**
- **Unidirectional** — use two pipes for bidirectional communication

Creation in UNIX:
```c
int fd[2];
pipe(fd);
```
- `fd[0]` — **read end** (read-only)
- `fd[1]` — **write end** (write-only)

```text
  Parent                          Child
  ──────                          ─────
  fd[1] ──write──▷ [  pipe  ] ──read──▷ fd[0]
```

- A pipe is a special file → accessed using standard `read()`, `write()` system calls
- The child **inherits** the pipe through fork()

</div>

---

# Ordinary Pipe — Code Example (Figures 3.21-3.22)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 25
#define READ_END    0
#define WRITE_END   1

int main(void)
{
    char write_msg[BUFFER_SIZE] = "Greetings";
    char read_msg[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int fd[2];
    pid_t pid;

    if (pipe(fd) == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Pipe failed");
        return 1;
    }

    pid = fork();

    if (pid > 0) {          /* Parent process */
        close(fd[READ_END]);
        write(fd[WRITE_END], write_msg, strlen(write_msg) + 1);
        close(fd[WRITE_END]);
    }
    else if (pid == 0) {    /* Child process */
        close(fd[WRITE_END]);
        read(fd[READ_END], read_msg, BUFFER_SIZE);
        printf("read %s", read_msg);
        close(fd[READ_END]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

</div>

---

# Ordinary Pipe — Key Points

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Rules that must be followed:

1. **Unused ends must be closed with close()**
   - If the parent only writes → `close(fd[READ_END])`
   - If the child only reads → `close(fd[WRITE_END])`

2. **Reason**: Essential for **EOF detection** in the pipe
   - The reader receives 0 (EOF) from `read()` only when all writers have closed the write end
   - If not closed, the reader may be stuck in a **perpetual blocking** state

3. **Process scope**:
   - An ordinary pipe **cannot be accessed from outside** the creating process
   - It can only be shared by inheriting it through fork()

</div>

---

# Pipes in Practice — Shell Usage

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Pipes using the `|` character in UNIX shells:

```text
ls -l | less
```

- `ls -l` (producer) — outputs the directory listing
- `less` (consumer) — displays one screen at a time
- stdout of ls is passed to stdin of less through the pipe

```text
cat file.txt | grep "error" | wc -l
```

- A **pipe chain** that finds lines containing "error" in file.txt and counts them
- Each command runs as a separate **process**

Similar on Windows:
```text
dir | more
```

# Named Pipes (FIFO)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Overcoming the limitations of ordinary pipes:

| Property | Ordinary Pipe | Named Pipe (FIFO) |
|---|---|---|
| Process relationship | Parent-child required | No relationship needed |
| Lifetime | Destroyed when process terminates | Exists in the file system, persists until explicitly deleted |
| Direction | Unidirectional | Bidirectional possible (UNIX: half-duplex) |
| Identification | fd[0], fd[1] | File system path |

Usage in UNIX:
```c
/* Creation */
mkfifo("/tmp/my_fifo", 0666);

/* Writer process */
int fd = open("/tmp/my_fifo", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "Hello", 6);

/* Reader process (separate program) */
int fd = open("/tmp/my_fifo", O_RDONLY);
read(fd, buf, 6);
```

</div>

# Named Pipes — UNIX vs Windows

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**UNIX Named Pipes (FIFOs)**:
- Created with the `mkfifo()` system call
- Manipulated with `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
- **Half-duplex** — two FIFOs needed for bidirectional data transfer
- Transmits only **byte-oriented** data
- Communication limited to the **same machine**

**Windows Named Pipes**:
- `CreateNamedPipe()`, `ConnectNamedPipe()`
- `ReadFile()`, `WriteFile()`
- Supports **full-duplex**
- Supports both **byte-oriented and message-oriented** data
- Can communicate **between different machines**

# Part 6
## Client-Server Communication
### Silberschatz Ch 3.8

# Sockets

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Socket** = An **endpoint** for communication

- Communication occurs through a pair of sockets (one per process)
- Identified by **IP address + Port number**

```text
  Host X (146.86.5.20)                Web Server (161.25.19.8)
  ┌──────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────┐
  │  Socket           │                │  Socket           │
  │  146.86.5.20:1625 │◄─────────────▶│  161.25.19.8:80   │
  └──────────────────┘                └──────────────────┘
```

- Client: assigned an arbitrary port greater than 1024 (e.g., 1625)
- Server: waits on a **well-known port** (HTTP=80, SSH=22, FTP=21)
- Every connection consists of a **unique pair of sockets**

</div>

---

# Socket: Well-Known Ports and Loopback

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Well-known ports** (below 1024):
| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| 22 | SSH |
| 21 | FTP |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 443 | HTTPS |

- Ports 1024 and above: assigned arbitrarily to clients

**Loopback address: 127.0.0.1**
- A special IP address that refers to the local machine itself
- Used for TCP/IP communication between client and server on the same host
- Does not pass through network hardware, making it useful for testing

Communication methods:
- **TCP** — connection-oriented, reliable byte stream
- **UDP** — connectionless, no reliability guarantee, fast

            /* Wait for client connections */
            while (true) {
                Socket client = sock.accept();
                PrintWriter pout = new
                    PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream(), true);

                /* Send current date to socket */
                pout.println(new java.util.Date().toString());

                /* Close socket and wait again */
                client.close();
            }

        catch (IOException ioe) {
            System.err.println(ioe);
        }
    }
}
```

- `ServerSocket(6013)`: listens on port 6013
- `accept()`: blocks until a connection request arrives

        catch (IOException ioe) {
            System.err.println(ioe);
        }
    }
}
```

- `Socket("127.0.0.1", 6013)`: connects to port 6013 on the local server
- In a real environment, use the server IP or hostname instead of 127.0.0.1

# Limitations of Sockets

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Socket-based communication is efficient but **low-level**:

- Only exchanges an **unstructured stream of bytes**
- Imposing structure on data is the **application's responsibility**
- Serialization, protocol design, etc. are required

> A higher level of abstraction is needed → **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**

Key idea of RPC:
- Use remote function calls **as if they were local function calls**
- **Abstract** the details of network communication

</div>

---

# Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**RPC** = A mechanism for calling procedures on a remote system connected via a network

Key components:

**1. Stub**
- A **proxy** on the client side
- Represents the server's actual procedure
- Packs parameters and sends them to the server

**2. Marshalling**
- Converting data into a format suitable for network transmission
- Resolves data representation differences between different architectures
  - Big-endian vs little-endian
- Uses standards such as **XDR (External Data Representation)**

# RPC: Execution Semantics

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

RPC can fail or be executed redundantly due to network errors.

**"At most once"**
- Attach a **timestamp** to each message
- The server maintains a history of processed timestamps
- Duplicate messages are **ignored**
- Even if the client sends multiple times, execution occurs at most once

**"Exactly once"**
- "At most once" + **ACK (acknowledgment)**
- The server sends an ACK to the client after completing execution
- The client **periodically retransmits** until it receives an ACK
- The most ideal but most complex to implement

</div>

---

# RPC: Binding (Port Binding)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

How does the client know the server's port number?

**Method 1: Fixed port addresses**
- Assign a fixed port number to the RPC at compile time
- Simple but inflexible — the server cannot change its port

**Method 2: Dynamic binding (Rendezvous / Matchmaker)**
- The OS provides a **matchmaker daemon** on a fixed RPC port
- Procedure:
  1. Client → matchmaker: "What is the port address for RPC X?"
  2. Matchmaker → Client: "It is port P"
  3. Client → port P: actual RPC call
- Initial overhead but provides **flexibility**

# Android RPC

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Android uses RPC as IPC within the same system through the **binder framework**

**Service** component:
- No UI, runs in the background
- A client binds to a service with `bindService()`
- Communicates via message passing or RPC

**AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language)**:
```java
/* RemoteService.aidl */
interface RemoteService {
    boolean remoteMethod(int x, double y);
}
```

- Stub code is automatically generated from the AIDL file
- The client calls it like a local method:
```java
service.remoteMethod(3, 0.14);
```
- Internally, the binder framework handles marshalling and inter-process delivery

# Lab 1: Execution Flow Analysis

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
  1. pipe(fd) → fd[0]=read, fd[1]=write created

  2. fork() → both parent and child have fd[0], fd[1]

  3. Parent:
     - close(fd[READ_END])    /* close read end */
     - write(fd[WRITE_END], "Hello from parent!", 19)
     - close(fd[WRITE_END])   /* close write end */
     - wait(NULL)             /* wait for child to terminate */

  4. Child:
     - close(fd[WRITE_END])   /* close write end */
     - read(fd[READ_END], ...)/* receive data sent by parent */
     - printf → "Child received: Hello from parent!"
     - close(fd[READ_END])

Produced: 30
Produced: 40
Consumed: 0
Consumed: 10

Behavior analysis:
- The producer (child) writes 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 to the pipe in order
- The consumer (parent) receives them in order using read()
- When the producer closes the write end, the consumer's `read()` returns 0 → loop terminates
- The actual output order may be interleaved depending on scheduling

# Lab 3: Key API Summary

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `shm_open(name, flags, mode)` | Create/open a shared memory object |
| `ftruncate(fd, size)` | Set the shared memory size |
| `mmap(addr, length, prot, flags, fd, offset)` | Map to the address space |
| `munmap(addr, length)` | Unmap |
| `shm_unlink(name)` | Delete the shared memory object |

Key flags:
- `O_CREAT` — create if it does not exist
- `O_RDWR` / `O_RDONLY` — read/write or read-only
- `PROT_READ` / `PROT_WRITE` — memory protection mode
- `MAP_SHARED` — changes are reflected to other processes

# Lab Key Takeaways

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**pipe()**:
- Creates a unidirectional communication channel between parent and child
- Read from fd[0], write to fd[1]
- Unused ends must be closed with close()
- The child inherits the pipe through fork()

**POSIX Shared Memory**:
- Follow the order: `shm_open()` → `ftruncate()` → `mmap()`
- Clean up with `munmap()` + `shm_unlink()` after use
- Other processes access it using the same name

**Common considerations**:
- In real systems, **synchronization** is critically important
- Techniques for preventing race conditions → covered in detail in Ch 6, 7
