# Week 06 — CPU Scheduling 1

## Overview
- **Textbook**: Silberschatz Ch 5 (CPU Scheduling) first half
- **xv6 Reference**: Ch 7.1–7.6 (Scheduling, Context Switching)
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Understand CPU Scheduling basics and Scheduling Criteria
  - Learn major scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, RR)
  - Observe the xv6 scheduler in action

## Class Schedule

### 1st Hour (Theory — Part 1) — 50 min
- [00:00–00:10] **Quiz** (10 min) — covers Week 5 material
- [00:10–00:15] Last week review / Announcements
- [00:15–00:50] Theory: CPU Scheduling Basics
  - CPU-I/O Burst Cycle, CPU Scheduler, Preemptive vs Non-preemptive
  - Scheduling Criteria (CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround, waiting, response time)
  - Slides: `theory/06_cpu_scheduling_1_en.md`

### 2nd Hour (Theory — Part 2) — 50 min
- [00:00–00:50] Theory: Scheduling Algorithms
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
