# Part 1

## The Security Problem

---

# Security vs Protection

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Security**: A measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved

**Protection**: A set of mechanisms that control the access of processes and users to resources

</div>

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Aspect | Security | Protection |
|------|----------|------------|
| Focus | Protecting the system from external threats | Controlling internal resource access |
| Target | Attackers, malware, network threats | Processes, users, roles |
| Scope | Physical, network, OS, application | Domains, access matrix, privileges |
| Textbook | Ch 16 | Ch 17 |

</div>

# Three Principles of Security: CIA Triad

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Principle | Full Name | Description | Violation Example |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Confidentiality | **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users can access information | Data eavesdropping, information leakage |
| Integrity | **Integrity** | Only authorized users can modify information | Data tampering, source code manipulation |
| Availability | **Availability** | Authorized users can access resources when needed | DoS attacks, system outages |

Additional types of security violations:
- **Theft of Service**: Unauthorized use of resources (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, spam relay)
- **Denial of Service**: Preventing legitimate users from using the system

</div>

---

# Threat vs Attack

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Threat**: A potential security violation — the discovery of a vulnerability

**Attack**: An actual attempt to breach security — a concrete action

</div>

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Major attack types:

| Attack Type | Description |
|----------|------|
| Masquerading | Impersonating another user/system |
| Replay Attack | Maliciously repeating a valid data transmission |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Intercepting or modifying data during communication |
| Session Hijacking | Taking over an active communication session |
| Privilege Escalation | Gaining higher privileges than authorized |

</div>

---

# Four-Layer Model of Security

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │   Application       │  ← Third-party app vulnerabilities, SQL injection
  ├─────────────────────┤
  │   Operating System   │  ← Privilege escalation, malware, misconfigurations
  ├─────────────────────┤
  │   Network            │  ← Sniffing, spoofing, DoS
  ├─────────────────────┤
  │   Physical           │  ← Physical access, equipment theft
  └─────────────────────┘
```

- Security is only as strong as its **weakest link** (chain analogy)
- **Human Factor**: Attacks exploiting people, such as social engineering and phishing
- **Attack Surface**: The set of points where an attacker can attempt to infiltrate

</div>

# Part 2

## Program Threats

---

# Malware Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Malware**: Software designed to exploit, disable, or damage a system

| Type | Description |
|------|------|
| **Trojan Horse** | Disguised as a legitimate program but executes malicious functions |
| **Spyware** | Secretly collects user information and sends it externally (adware, keylogger) |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption |
| **Back Door (Trap Door)** | A secret access path left by a developer |
| **Logic Bomb** | Malicious code that activates when specific conditions are met |

- Trojan Horse variant: **login emulator** (fake login screen)
- Violating the **principle of least privilege** maximizes malware damage

</div>

---

# Trojan Horse Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Login Emulator Attack Scenario:**

```text
  1. Attacker leaves a fake login screen running
  2. Victim attempts to log in → "Password error" message displayed
  3. In reality, the ID/PW are sent to the attacker
  4. The fake program exits and the real login prompt appears
  5. Victim thinks "It was a typo" and logs in again (succeeds normally)
```

**Defenses:**
- Use non-trappable key sequences like **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** (Windows)
- Display session usage information at session termination
- Verify URL accuracy (phishing prevention)

</div>

---

# Ransomware and the Principle of Least Privilege

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Ransomware Operation:**

```text
  1. Malware infection (phishing emails, vulnerable services, etc.)
  2. Encrypts files on the system using strong encryption algorithms
  3. Demands payment (cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key
  4. No guarantee of receiving the decryption key even after payment
```

**The Principle of Least Privilege**:
- Grant programs and users only the **minimum privileges** needed to perform their tasks
- Excessive privileges allow malware to take over the entire system
- The OS should provide **fine-grained access control**

</div>

---

# Code Injection — Buffer Overflow

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Most security threats occur through code injection

**Buffer Overflow**: Overwriting adjacent memory by providing input that exceeds buffer boundaries

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define BUFFER_SIZE 64

void vulnerable(char *input) {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    strcpy(buffer, input);   // No length check → overflow possible
}

// Safe version
void safe(char *input) {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);  // Length limited
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
}
```

- `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`, `gets()` are **dangerous functions**
- Use size-aware functions like `strncpy()`, `snprintf()` instead

</div>

---

# Consequences of Buffer Overflow

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
  Stack (high address → low address):
  ┌──────────────────┐
  │  Return Address   │  ← (3) If attacker overwrites this, they control code flow
  ├──────────────────┤
  │  Saved EBP        │  ← (2) Frame pointer can be corrupted
  ├──────────────────┤
  │  Local Variables   │  ← (2) Adjacent variables overwritten
  ├──────────────────┤
  │  buffer[64]        │  ← (1) Within padding range: no effect
  └──────────────────┘
         ↑ overflow direction
```

Consequences depending on overflow size:
1. **Small overflow** → Absorbed by padding area, no impact
2. **Medium overflow** → Overwrites adjacent variables, possible program crash
3. **Large overflow** → **Return address corruption** → Arbitrary code (shellcode) execution

</div>

---

# Shellcode and NOP-sled

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Shellcode**: Code injected by the attacker (typically spawns a shell)

```c
void exploit(void) {
    execvp("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", NULL);  // Spawn shell
}
```

Attack process:
1. Attacker includes shellcode in user input
2. Buffer overflow changes the return address to point to the shellcode location
3. Shellcode executes when the function returns

**NOP-sled**: Since hitting the exact address is difficult, a large number of NOP instructions are placed before the shellcode

```text
  [NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP ... NOP] [SHELLCODE]
   ←── NOP-sled ──────────→     ← payload
```

- **Script kiddie**: A novice attacker who uses exploits created by other hackers

</div>

---

# SQL Injection

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

An attack that inserts SQL statements into user input to manipulate the database

```text
  Normal input:     username = "alice"
  SQL query:        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'alice'

  Malicious input:  username = "' OR '1'='1"
  SQL query:        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'
  → All records are returned (authentication bypass)
```

**Defenses:**
- Use **Prepared Statements** (parameterized queries)
- Input **validation** and **sanitization**
- Grant minimum privileges to DB accounts

```java
// Safe approach (Prepared Statement)
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
stmt.setString(1, username);  // Automatic escaping
```

</div>

---

# Viruses

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Virus**: Self-replicating code that spreads by **inserting itself** into other programs

- **Requires a host program** (cannot run independently)
- Mainly spreads through user actions (executing files, email attachments)

| Virus Type | Description |
|-----------|------|
| **File Virus** | Inserts into executable files (parasitic virus) |
| **Boot Virus** | Infects the boot sector, executes before OS loads |
| **Macro Virus** | Inserts into document macros (VBA, etc.), infects Office files |
| **Polymorphic** | Mutates code on each infection → evades signature detection |
| **Encrypted** | Contains encrypted virus + decryption code |
| **Stealth** | Evades detection by modifying system calls |
| **Rootkit** | Infects the OS itself, takes over the entire system |
| **Armored** | Obfuscated to make analysis difficult |

</div>

---

# Worms

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Worm**: Malware that propagates **autonomously** through networks

- **No host program required** (can run independently)
- Automatically spreads through the network → generates massive traffic

**Virus vs Worm Comparison:**

| Property | Virus | Worm |
|------|-------|------|
| Host Program | Required | Not required |
| Propagation | User action (file execution) | Automatic via network |
| Self-replication | Inserts into other programs | Independent replication |
| Primary Damage | File corruption, system failure | Network paralysis, resource exhaustion |

- **Morris Worm** (1988): First internet worm, exploited buffer overflow
- Modern worms are used to build botnets (DDoS, spam distribution)

</div>

# Part 3

## System and Network Threats

---

# Attacking Network Traffic

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Attack Type | Description | Classification |
|----------|------|------|
| **Sniffing** | Eavesdropping on network packets to steal information | Passive attack |
| **Spoofing** | Forging IP/MAC addresses to impersonate a trusted source | Active attack |
| **Man-in-the-Middle** | Intercepting and modifying data during communication | Active attack |

```text
  Normal:        Alice ──────────────→ Bob

  Sniffing:      Alice ──────────────→ Bob
                           ↑
                        Mallory (eavesdropping)

  MITM:          Alice ───→ Mallory ───→ Bob
                       ←───         ←───
                 (each thinks they are communicating with the other)
```

- **Zombie system**: A system hijacked by a hacker, used to conceal the source of attacks
- WarDriving: Searching for unprotected WiFi networks to gain access

</div>

---

# Denial of Service (DoS / DDoS)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**DoS**: Disrupting normal service by sending excessive requests to a server

| Type | Description |
|------|------|
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Depleting CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc. |
| **Network Disruption** | Disabling the network itself |
| **DDoS** | Simultaneous attack from multiple zombies (botnet) |

**SYN Flood Attack:**

```text
  Attacker → [SYN] → Server     (connection request)
  Server   → [SYN-ACK] → ???    (waiting for response)
  ※ ACK never arrives, half-open connections accumulate
  → Server's connection table exhausted → legitimate connections denied
```

- DDoS is sometimes combined with **blackmail** (extortion)
- Defenses: rate limiting, upstream filtering, adding resources

</div>

---

# Port Scanning

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Port Scanning**: Probing open ports to discover vulnerable services

- Not an attack itself, but a **reconnaissance** phase
- Security administrators also use it for service auditing

```text
  Attacker → Port 21 (FTP)     → No response (closed)
  Attacker → Port 22 (SSH)     → Response (open!) → Check version
  Attacker → Port 80 (HTTP)    → Response (open!) → Identify web server
  Attacker → Port 443 (HTTPS)  → Response (open!)
  ...
```

**Fingerprinting**: Identifying the OS type and service versions to search for known vulnerabilities

Key tools:
- **nmap**: Network exploration and security auditing tool
- **Metasploit**: Vulnerability exploit testing framework

</div>

# Part 4

## Cryptography

---

# Cryptography Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Cryptography**: Technology that enables secure communication over untrusted channels in network environments

Components of a cryptographic algorithm:
- **K** = Set of keys
- **M** = Set of plaintext messages
- **C** = Set of ciphertexts
- **E** : K → (M → C) — Encryption function
- **D** : K → (C → M) — Decryption function

Key property: Given a ciphertext c, recovering the original message m without the key k is **computationally infeasible**

| Type | Key Structure | Speed | Key Exchange |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| Symmetric | Same key | Fast | Difficult |
| Asymmetric | Public/private key pair | Slow | Secure |

</div>

---

# Symmetric Encryption

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Encryption and decryption performed with the same key (k)

```text
  Plaintext m ──[Key k]──→ Ciphertext c = Ek(m) ──[Key k]──→ Plaintext m = Dk(c)
                Encryption                          Decryption
```

| Algorithm | Key Length | Characteristics |
|----------|---------|------|
| **DES** | 56-bit | No longer secure, vulnerable to brute-force |
| **3DES** | 168-bit | DES repeated 3 times: c = Ek3(Dk2(Ek1(m))) |
| **AES** | 128/192/256-bit | Current standard, fast and secure |

- **Block Cipher**: Encrypts in fixed-size blocks (e.g., AES 128-bit block)
- **Stream Cipher**: Encrypts byte/bit by byte continuously, using XOR operations
- Drawback: Both sides must share the same key → **key exchange problem**

</div>

---

# Asymmetric Encryption

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Encrypt with public key, decrypt with private key

```text
  Plaintext m ──[Public Key ke]──→ Ciphertext c ──[Private Key kd]──→ Plaintext m
                 Encryption                          Decryption
```

**RSA Algorithm** (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman):
- p, q: Two large prime numbers, N = p × q
- Public key ke: ke × kd mod (p-1)(q-1) = 1
- Encryption: c = m^ke mod N
- Decryption: m = c^kd mod N

**RSA Example** (small numbers):

```text
  p=7, q=13 → N=91, (p-1)(q-1)=72
  ke=5, kd=29 (5×29 mod 72 = 1)
  Encryption: 69^5 mod 91 = 62
  Decryption: 62^29 mod 91 = 69
```

</div>

---

# Symmetric vs Asymmetric Comparison

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Property | Symmetric | Asymmetric |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Key Structure | One shared key | Public key + private key pair |
| Speed | **Fast** | Slow (tens to hundreds of times slower) |
| Key Exchange | Requires a secure channel | Public key freely distributed |
| Use Cases | Bulk data encryption | Authentication, key exchange, small data |
| Representative Algorithms | AES, DES | RSA, ECC |

**Practical Usage (Hybrid Encryption):**

```text
  1. Exchange symmetric key securely using asymmetric encryption
  2. Subsequent communication uses symmetric encryption (better performance)

  [Exchange AES key via RSA] → [Encrypt/decrypt data via AES]
```

- TLS/SSL uses this approach

</div>

---

# Hashing (Hash Functions)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Hash Function** H(m): Arbitrary-length message → **Fixed-length hash value** (message digest)

Properties:
- **One-way**: Cannot recover the original from the hash value
- **Collision Resistant**: Computationally infeasible for different inputs to produce the same hash
- Even a 1-bit change in input **completely changes** the hash (avalanche effect)

```text
  "Hello World"  ──[SHA-256]──→ a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190...
  "Hello World!" ──[SHA-256]──→ 7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65d...
```

| Algorithm | Output Length | Status |
|----------|----------|------|
| MD5 | 128-bit | **Not secure** |
| SHA-1 | 160-bit | Being phased out |
| SHA-256 | 256-bit | **Current standard** |
| SHA-3 | Variable | Latest standard |

</div>

---

# Hash Applications — Password Storage

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Store hash values instead of **plaintext passwords**

```text
  Registration: password → H(password) → Store hash in DB
  Authentication: input → H(input) → Compare with stored hash
```

**Salt**: A random value added to the hash for enhanced security

```text
  Without salt:  H("password123") → abc123...  (same password = same hash)
  With salt:     H("password123" + "x7k9")  → def456...
                 H("password123" + "m2p5")  → ghi789...
                 (same password with different salts produces different hashes)
```

- **Dictionary Attack Prevention**: With salt, every dictionary word must be hashed for each salt combination
- UNIX `/etc/shadow` file: Stores hashed passwords readable only by the superuser

</div>

---

# Digital Signature

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A mechanism for verifying the **integrity** and **origin** of a message

- Uses public key cryptography in **reverse**: sign with private key, verify with public key

```text
  Signature creation:  signature = H(m)^ks mod N   (sign with private key ks)
  Signature verification:  H(m) =? signature^kv mod N  (verify with public key kv)
```

**MAC (Message Authentication Code)**:
- Authentication using a symmetric key → only key holders can create/verify

**Applications of Digital Signatures:**
- **Nonrepudiation**: The signer cannot deny the action
- **Code Signing**: Verifying the integrity and origin of programs
- **Electronic Document Signing**: Digital contracts, certificates

</div>

---

# Digital Certificates

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

An electronic document in which a **Certificate Authority (CA)** vouches for the owner of a public key

```text
  Certificate:
    Subject: www.example.com
    Public Key: [RSA 2048-bit key]
    Issuer: Trusted CA
    Validity: 2025-01-01 ~ 2026-12-31
    Signature: [Signed with CA's private key]
```

**Certificate Chain (Chain of Trust):**

```text
  Root CA (built into browser)
    ↓ signs
  Intermediate CA
    ↓ signs
  Server Certificate (www.example.com)
```

- **X.509**: Standard format for digital certificates
- The CA's public key is **pre-installed in the browser**
- Man-in-the-Middle prevention: Verify public key authenticity via certificates

</div>

---

# TLS (Transport Layer Security)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

The encryption protocol underlying HTTPS (successor to SSL)

**TLS Handshake Process:**

```text
  Client                              Server
    │                                    │
    │──── ClientHello (nc) ────────→     │ (1) Send random value
    │                                    │
    │←──── ServerHello (ns) ────────     │ (2) Server random value +
    │←──── Certificate (certs) ────      │     send certificate
    │                                    │
    │   [Verify certificate]             │ (3) Verify CA signature
    │                                    │
    │──── Eke(pms) ────────────→         │ (4) Encrypt premaster secret
    │                                    │     with public key and send
    │                                    │
    │   ms = H(nc, ns, pms)              │ (5) Both sides compute
    │   (Generate symmetric session key) │     the same master secret
    │                                    │
    │←──── [AES encrypted comm] ────→    │ (6) Communicate with symmetric key
```

</div>

---

# Key Distribution Problem

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Symmetric encryption key exchange problem:**
- N parties communicating with each other require N(N-1)/2 keys
- A secure channel is needed to deliver keys → out-of-band exchange has low scalability

**Asymmetric encryption public key distribution problem:**

```text
  Man-in-the-Middle on Public Key:

  Alice ──→ [Request Public Key] ──→ Bob
                     ↑
              Mallory sends her
              own Public Key

  Alice encrypts with Mallory's public key
  → Mallory decrypts, then re-encrypts with Bob's public key and forwards
```

**Solution**: Public key authentication via Digital Certificates
- CA vouches for the public key owner → prevents MITM

# Part 5

## User Authentication

---

# User Authentication Methods

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Three factors for verifying a user's identity:

| Factor | Category | Examples |
|------|------|------|
| **Something you know** | Knowledge | Password, PIN, security questions |
| **Something you have** | Possession | Smart card, OTP token, smartphone |
| **Something you are** | Biometrics | Fingerprint, iris, facial recognition, voice |

**Password-based Authentication:**
- Most common but has various vulnerabilities
- Trade-off between convenience and security

</div>

---

# Password Vulnerabilities

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Attack Type | Description |
|----------|------|
| **Dictionary Attack** | Tries dictionary words and variations in sequence |
| **Brute Force** | Tries all possible combinations (short passwords are vulnerable) |
| **Social Engineering** | Tricks users into directly revealing passwords |
| **Shoulder Surfing** | Observing input over someone's shoulder |
| **Sniffing** | Stealing passwords from network traffic |
| **Phishing** | Inducing password entry via fake websites/emails |
| **Keylogger** | Malware that records keyboard input |

- 4-digit password: 10,000 possibilities → crackable in ~5,000 attempts on average
- At 1ms/attempt → cracked in **about 5 seconds**
- Countermeasures: Long passwords, mixed uppercase+lowercase+digits+special characters, attempt limits

</div>

---

# One-Time Password (OTP)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**OTP**: A password that can be used only once → prevents sniffing and replay attacks

```text
  Challenge-Response method:
  1. Server → Client: send challenge (ch)
  2. Client: compute H(password, ch) → send authenticator
  3. Server: perform the same computation → compare results
  → Different challenge each time, so authenticator is different each time
```

**OTP Implementation Methods:**
- Hardware tokens (RSA SecurID, etc.)
- Software apps (Google Authenticator, etc.)
- SMS authentication codes

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
- "Something you have" (token) + "Something you know" (PIN)
- Even if one is compromised, the other provides protection

</div>

---

# Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Combining two or more authentication factors for enhanced security

```text
  Single factor:  Password only → Vulnerable

  2FA examples:   Password (knowledge) + OTP (possession)
                  Password (knowledge) + Fingerprint (biometrics)

  3FA example:    Password (knowledge) + Smart card (possession) + Facial recognition (biometrics)
```

| Auth Level | Factors | Security Strength | Use Cases |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Single factor | 1 | Low | General websites |
| 2FA | 2 | Medium | Online banking |
| 3FA | 3 | High | Military/government systems |

**Biometrics Pros and Cons:**
- Pros: Cannot be lost/stolen, high uniqueness
- Cons: False recognition rates exist, cannot be changed, privacy concerns

# Part 6

## Goals and Principles of Protection

---

# Goals of Protection

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Protection**: OS mechanisms that control resource access by processes and users

Why Protection is needed:
1. Prevent malicious access violations
2. Ensure system resources are used only according to defined policies
3. **Early detection of interface errors** between components → improved system reliability

**Policy vs Mechanism:**

| Aspect | Description | Example |
|------|------|------|
| Policy | Decides **what** to do | "Students can only read their own files" |
| Mechanism | Decides **how** to do it | Access matrix, ACL |

- **Separation** of policy and mechanism is important → no need to modify the mechanism when the policy changes

</div>

---

# Key Principles of Protection

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Principle of Least Privilege**:
- Grant users/processes only the **minimum privileges** needed for their tasks
- The practice of not running as root in UNIX is a representative example
- Excessive privileges expand the scope of damage from errors or attacks

**Compartmentalization** (isolation):
- Divide the system into independent zones
- Prevent a breach in one zone from affecting others
- Examples: DMZ, virtualization, containers

**Defense in Depth** (layered defense):
- Deploy multiple layers of security → if one layer is breached, the next layer defends

```text
  [Firewall] → [IDS/IPS] → [OS Access Control] → [Application Auth] → [Data Encryption]
```

- **Audit Trail**: Record access logs for attack detection and analysis

</div>

---

# Need-to-Know Principle

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Need-to-Know**: A process should only be able to access resources needed for its current task

```text
  When Process P calls Procedure A():
  - A() can only access its local variables and passed parameters
  - Cannot access other variables of Process P

  When Process P invokes the Compiler:
  - The Compiler can only access related files (source file, output file, etc.)
  - Cannot access arbitrary files
```

| Concept | Role |
|------|------|
| Need-to-Know | **Policy** — Decides what access to allow |
| Least Privilege | **Mechanism** — Means to implement the policy |

Hardware-level privilege hierarchy — based on the **Bell-LaPadula model**

```text
  ┌───────────────────────────┐
  │       Ring 3 (User)       │  ← General applications
  │   ┌───────────────────┐   │
  │   │   Ring 2          │   │  ← Device drivers (some OSes)
  │   │   ┌───────────┐   │   │
  │   │   │  Ring 1    │   │   │  ← OS services
  │   │   │  ┌─────┐   │   │   │

  │   │   └───────────┘   │   │
  │   └───────────────────┘   │
  └───────────────────────────┘
```

- Ring i provides only a subset of Ring j (j < i) functionality
- Ring 0 has the highest privilege (full privileges)
- Transition to a higher ring is only possible through a **gate** (e.g., system call)

# Intel and ARM Protection Rings

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Platform | Structure | Description |
|--------|------|------|
| **Intel x86** | Ring 0~3 | Mostly only Ring 0 (kernel) and Ring 3 (user) are used |
| **Intel VT-x** | Ring -1 added | For hypervisor (VMM) |
| **ARM (early)** | USR / SVC | User mode / Supervisor mode |
| **ARM TrustZone** | Secure / Normal World | Hardware-based secure zone separation |
| **ARMv8** | EL0~EL3 | 4-level Exception Levels |

**ARMv8 Exception Levels:**

```text
  EL3  Secure Monitor (TrustZone)    ← Highest privilege
  EL2  Hypervisor                     ← VM management
  EL1  OS Kernel                      ← Kernel
  EL0  User Application               ← General apps
```

- **TrustZone**: Protects on-chip cryptographic keys, even the kernel cannot access directly
- Android 5.0+: Actively uses TrustZone for password and encryption key protection

# Part 8

## Domain of Protection

---

# Domain Structure

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Domain**: The set of resources and privileges that a process can access

```text
  Domain = { <object-name, rights-set>, ... }

  D1 = { <File1, {read}>, <File2, {read, write}> }
  D2 = { <File2, {read}>, <Printer, {write}> }
  D3 = { <File1, {execute}>, <File3, {read}> }
```

**Domain Association Methods:**
- **Static**: Domain fixed for the process lifetime → may grant excessive privileges
- **Dynamic**: Process can switch between domains → adheres to the need-to-know principle

**Domain Implementations:**
- **User-based**: Per-user domain, switches on logout/login
- **Process-based**: Per-process domain, switches via message passing
- **Procedure-based**: Per-procedure domain, switches on function calls

</div>

---

# Domain Switching

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A process transitioning from one domain to another

```text
  User Process (Ring 3, User Domain)
       │
       │ system call (syscall instruction)
       ↓
  Kernel (Ring 0, Kernel Domain)    ← domain switch
       │
       │ return
       ↓
  User Process (Ring 3, User Domain)
```

**UNIX setuid Mechanism:**
- Setting the setuid bit on an executable → runs with the **file owner's privileges**
- Example: `passwd` command → owned by root, setuid set → regular users can modify `/etc/shadow`
- Risk: If a setuid binary has a vulnerability → **privilege escalation** is possible

**Android Application ID:**
- Each app is assigned a unique UID/GID → isolation between apps
- Each app owns its data directory `/data/data/<app-name>`

# Part 9

## Access Matrix

---

# Access Matrix Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A model that represents resource access rights as a **matrix**

| | F1 | F2 | F3 | Printer |
|------|------|------|------|---------|
| **D1** | read | read, write | | |
| **D2** | | read | read | write |
| **D3** | read, write | | read, write | |
| **D4** | read, write | | read, write | |

- **Row**: Domain (subject) — users, processes, roles
- **Column**: Object — files, devices, memory regions
- **Cell**: Access Rights — read, write, execute, etc.

Problem: In real systems, most of the matrix is **empty** (sparse matrix)
→ Efficient implementation methods are needed

</div>

---

# Access Matrix Extension — Domain Switching

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Include domains as **objects** to control domain switching

| | F1 | F2 | F3 | Printer | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 |
|------|------|------|------|---------|------|------|------|------|
| **D1** | read | | read | | | switch | | |
| **D2** | | read, write | | | | | switch | switch |
| **D3** | | | execute | | | | | |
| **D4** | read, write | | read, write | | switch | | | |

- `switch` in access(i, j) → switching from domain Di to Dj is allowed
- Example: D2 can switch to D3 or D4

</div>

---

# Modifying Access Rights — Copy, Owner, Control

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Copy Right** (`*`):
- `read*` → the right can be copied to another domain in the same column
- Transfer: Copy then remove the original
- Limited Copy: Copy without `*` → re-copying not allowed

**Owner Right**:
- If access(i, j) includes owner → Di can add/delete all entries in column j
- The file owner sets other users' access rights

**Control Right**:
- Applies only to domain objects
- If access(i, j) includes control → Di can delete access rights in row j

**Confinement Problem**: The problem of ensuring information does not leak outside the execution environment
→ Generally unsolvable (undecidable)

</div>

# Part 10

## Implementation of Access Matrix

---

# Global Table

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

The simplest implementation: A complete table of `<domain, object, rights-set>` triples

```text
  < D1, F1, {read} >
  < D1, F2, {read, write} >
  < D2, F2, {read} >
  < D2, Printer, {write} >
  < D3, F1, {read, write} >
  < D3, F3, {read, write} >
  ...
```

**Advantages**: Simple to implement

**Disadvantages**:
- Table is very large, **difficult to store in main memory** → additional I/O required
- Cannot leverage special grouping (e.g., "all domains can read F1" → requires individual entries for every domain)

</div>

---

# Access List for Objects (ACL)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Implemented based on **columns** of the Access Matrix — each object has a linked (domain, rights) list

```text
  File1:    [(D1, {read}), (D3, {read, write})]
  File2:    [(D1, {read, write}), (D2, {read})]
  File3:    [(D2, {read}), (D3, {read, write})]
  Printer:  [(D2, {write})]
```

- **Default Rights**: Can set default access rights for domains not in the list
- On access request: Search the object's ACL to check the domain's rights

**Advantages**: Directly addresses user needs (specify access rights when creating files)

**Disadvantages**:
- Difficult to check all access rights for a specific domain
- ACL search required on every access → long lists cause performance degradation

</div>

---

# Capability List for Domains

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Implemented based on **rows** of the Access Matrix — each domain has a linked (object, rights) list

```text
  D1:  [(File1, {read}), (File2, {read, write})]
  D2:  [(File2, {read}), (File3, {read}), (Printer, {write})]
  D3:  [(File1, {read, write}), (File3, {read, write})]
```

**Capability**: A protected pointer representing access rights to an object
- Possessing a capability grants access
- Managed by the OS; users cannot modify them directly

**Methods for Protecting Capabilities:**
- **Tag method**: Hardware uses a tag bit to distinguish capabilities from regular data
- **Separate address space**: Store capability lists in separate memory accessible only by the OS

</div>

---

# Lock-Key Mechanism

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A **compromise** between ACL and Capability List

```text
  Assign a Lock (bit pattern) to each Object:
    File1: Lock = [1010]
    File2: Lock = [0110]

  Assign a Key (bit pattern) to each Domain:
    D1: Key = [1010]  → Matches File1's Lock → Access granted
    D2: Key = [0110]  → Matches File2's Lock → Access granted
```

- Access is granted if the Key matches the Lock
- Keys can be freely transferred between domains
- Changing the Lock enables effective **revocation of rights**

</div>

---

# Implementation Method Comparison

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Method | Basis | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Global Table** | Entire matrix | Simple implementation | Large table size, no grouping |
| **ACL** | Column (Object) | Intuitive for users, easy revocation | Hard to determine per-domain rights |
| **Capability** | Row (Domain) | Fast access verification, process-centric | Difficult revocation |
| **Lock-Key** | Matching | Flexible, easy revocation | Key management complexity |

**Real Systems**: Use a **combination** of ACL + Capability
- **File open**: Verify access rights via ACL
- Create a **capability (file descriptor)** → subsequent access verified quickly via capability
- **File close**: Delete the capability
- Example: UNIX file system (open → fd → read/write → close)

</div>

---

# Revocation of Access Rights

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Considerations when revoking rights:

| Question | Options |
|------|--------|
| Timing | **Immediate** vs **Delayed** |
| Scope | **Selective** vs **General** |
| Extent | **Partial** vs **Total** |
| Duration | **Temporary** vs **Permanent** |

| Method | ACL | Capability |
|------|-----|------------|
| Ease of Revocation | **Easy** — delete from the list | **Difficult** — must find distributed capabilities |
| Immediate Effect | Yes | Depends on the method |

**Capability Revocation Methods:**
- **Reacquisition**: Periodically delete capabilities, requiring re-acquisition
- **Back-pointers**: Each object maintains a list of capability pointers (MULTICS)
- **Indirection**: Indirect reference through a global table (CAL)
- **Keys**: Invalidate existing capabilities by changing the master key

# Part 11

## Access Control Models

---

# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Access control through User → **Role** → Permission mapping

```text
  Users            Roles              Permissions
  ┌──────┐       ┌──────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐
  │ Alice │──→   │  Admin   │──→    │ File: read/write │
  │  Bob  │──→   │  Editor  │──→    │ File: read/write │
  │ Carol │──→   │  Viewer  │──→    │ File: read       │
  └──────┘       └──────────┘       └──────────────────┘
```

**Advantages of RBAC:**
- Efficient management at the **role level** even with many users
- Easy to apply the **principle of least privilege** — assign only necessary roles
- When a user leaves the organization, simply remove them from the role
- First fully adopted in Solaris 10
- Assign privileges to roles, then assign roles to users

</div>

---

# DAC vs MAC

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Property | DAC (Discretionary) | MAC (Mandatory) |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Definition | Resource owner sets access rights | System-enforced access control policy |
| Permission Setting | User (owner) | System administrator/policy |
| Root Privileges | Root can access everything | **Root cannot change the policy** |
| Flexibility | High | Low (subject to policy) |
| Security Strength | Relatively low | High |
| Examples | UNIX file permissions | SELinux, macOS SIP |

**Limitations of DAC:**
- Owners can arbitrarily set/change permissions
- No restrictions on root user

**Need for MAC:**
- Even if root privileges are obtained, access is blocked by policy
- Essential for military/government agencies

</div>

---

# MAC — Security Labels

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Core of MAC: **Labels** (security labels)

- Assign labels to subjects (processes) and objects (files, devices)
- Policy determines whether access between labels is allowed/denied

```text
  Security levels:  Unclassified < Secret < Top Secret

  "Secret" user:
    ✓ Can access "Unclassified" files
    ✓ Can access "Secret" files
    ✗ Cannot access "Top Secret" files (cannot even see they exist)
```

**SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux):
- MAC implementation in the Linux kernel, developed by the NSA
- Fine-grained access control via policy files
- Integrated into most Linux distributions

**Other implementations**: macOS (TrustedBSD-based), Windows (Mandatory Integrity Control)

</div>

---

# Linux Capabilities

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Subdividing root privileges to grant processes only the **necessary permissions**

```text
  Traditional UNIX:  root = all privileges (all-or-nothing)

  Linux Capabilities:
    CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE  → Bind to ports below 1024
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN         → System administration tasks
    CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE      → Override file access controls
    CAP_NET_RAW           → Use raw sockets
    ... (managed as bitmasks)
```

**Three Bitmasks:**
- **Permitted**: Capabilities that are allowed
- **Effective**: Currently active capabilities
- **Inheritable**: Capabilities that can be inherited by child processes

- Once a capability is **revoked, it cannot be reacquired**
- Direct implementation of the **principle of least privilege**
- Android also uses Linux capabilities (avoiding root for system processes)

# Part 12

## Sandboxing and Code Signing

---

# Sandboxing

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Isolating** a program's execution environment to limit its impact on the system

| Example | Description |
|------|------|
| **Web Browser** | Isolates each tab/plugin in a separate process |
| **Mobile App** | Independent filesystem and permission system per app |
| **Container** | Application environment isolation via Docker, etc. |
| **Virtual Machine** | Complete isolation at the hardware level |
| **Java/JVM** | Sandbox restrictions at the virtual machine level |

**Sandboxing Implementation Methods:**
- **MAC policy-based**: SELinux labels (Android)
- **System-call Filtering**: SECCOMP-BPF (Linux)
  - Limits the system calls a process can invoke
- **Profile-based**: Apple Seatbelt (macOS)
  - Dynamic profiles written in Scheme language
  - Custom profiles per binary

</div>

---

# Sandboxing Profile Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**macOS Sandbox Profile** (Scheme language):

```scheme
(version 1)
(deny default)                              ; Deny all operations by default
(allow file-chroot)                         ; Allow chroot
(allow file-read-metadata (literal "/var")) ; Allow reading /var metadata
(allow sysctl-read)                         ; Allow sysctl reads
(allow mach-per-user-lookup)
(allow mach-lookup
  (global-name "com.apple.system.logger"))  ; Allow access only to logger service
```

**SECCOMP-BPF** (Linux):
- Define system call filters using Berkeley Packet Filter language
- Apply to processes via `prctl()` system call
- Restrictions inherited by child processes on fork
- Automatically applied to all apps in Android Bionic C library

</div>

---

# Code Signing

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Verify code **integrity** and **origin** through **digital signatures**

```text
  Developer                          User System
  ┌────────┐                        ┌──────────┐
  │ Code   │──[Private Key]──→ Signature
  └────────┘                        │
                                    │ Verification
  Code + Signature ──[Public Key]──→ Integrity/origin check
                                    │
                                    ├─ Success: Allow execution
                                    └─ Failure: Block execution or warn
```

| OS | Implementation |
|------|------|
| **Windows** | Driver Signing, Authenticode |
| **macOS** | Gatekeeper, SIP (System Integrity Protection) |
| **iOS** | All apps require signing, Apple signs for App Store distribution |
| **Android** | APK Signing (developer signature) |

- **Block or warn** when unsigned code is executed
- Apple **Entitlements**: Permissions declared in XML plist, included in the code signature

</div>

# System Integrity Protection (SIP)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A **system protection mechanism** introduced in macOS 10.11

**SIP Features:**
- Restricts access to system files and resources
- **Even the root user** cannot modify system files
- Only allows code-signed kernel extensions
- Prevents debugging/tampering of system binaries

```text
  Traditional UNIX:
    root → Can access/modify all files

  With SIP:
    root → Can manage other users' files
           Can install/remove programs
           ✗ Cannot modify system files
           ✗ Cannot tamper with kernel extensions
```

- SIP is enforced on all processes at boot time
- Only Apple-signed binaries with **Entitlements** are exceptions
