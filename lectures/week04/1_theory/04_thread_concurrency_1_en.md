# Part 1
## Overview: The Concept of Threads
### Silberschatz Ch 4.1

---

# What Is a Thread?

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Thread** = a **unit of CPU utilization** within a process

What each thread **independently owns**:
- Thread ID
- Program Counter (PC)
- Register Set
- **Stack** (function calls, local variables)

What threads in the same process **share**:
- Code section (program code)
- Data section (global variables)
- OS resources (open files, signals, etc.)

> Traditional process = single thread of control
> Modern process = multiple threads of control

</div>

```

- Single-threaded: one execution flow, one PC, one stack
- Multithreaded: **multiple execution flows**, each with its own independent PC and stack
- **Code, data, and files are shared by all threads**

# Thread vs Process Comparison

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Category | Process | Thread |
|------|---------|--------|
| Creation cost | **High** (memory and resource allocation) | **Low** (only stack and registers needed) |
| Context Switch | **Slow** (address space switch) | **Fast** (same address space) |
| Memory sharing | Isolated by default (IPC required) | **Naturally shared** (code, data) |
| Independence | High (one dying has little effect on others) | Low (one dying can affect the entire process) |
| Communication | IPC required (pipe, socket, etc.) | Direct communication via global variables |

> Threads are also called **"lightweight processes."**

</div>

# Why Use Threads? — Real-World Examples

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Web Browser**:
- Thread 1: Receive data from the network
- Thread 2: Render images and text
- Thread 3: Handle user input

**Word Processor**:
- Thread 1: Display the document on screen
- Thread 2: Handle keystrokes
- Thread 3: Spell/grammar checking (background)

**Photo App — Thumbnail Generation**:
- Each image in a collection is processed by a separate thread
- Parallel processing reduces total elapsed time

</div>

# Multithreaded Web Server (Figure 4.2)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
                      ┌──────────────┐
   (1) request ──────▷│              │
   client             │   Server     │ (2) Create a new thread
                      │   Process    │     to handle the request
                      │              │
                      │    ┌─thread──┤ (3) Server resumes

                      └────┴─────────┘
```

**Traditional approach**: Create a new **process** per request → time-consuming, resource-wasteful

**Modern approach**: Create a new **thread** per request
- Shares the same address space, so it is **fast and lightweight**
- Advantageous for handling large numbers of concurrent connections

> The Linux kernel is also multithreaded — `kthreadd` (pid=2) is the parent of all kernel threads

# Part 2
## Benefits of Multithreading
### Silberschatz Ch 4.1.2

# Four Benefits of Threads

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**1. Responsiveness**
- The UI thread can continue to respond
- Long-running operations execute **asynchronously** in a separate thread
- Example: the interface remains responsive even during lengthy processing after a button click

**2. Resource Sharing**
- Sharing between processes requires shared memory or message passing
- Threads share code, data, and files **by default**
- Multiple activities can be performed within the same address space

</div>

---

# Four Benefits of Threads (continued)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**3. Economy**
- Thread creation is **much cheaper** than process creation
  - Lower memory allocation and resource allocation costs
- Context switching between threads is also **much faster**
  - Same address space, so no TLB flush is needed

**4. Scalability**
- True **parallel execution** is possible on multiprocessor/multicore systems
- A single-threaded process uses **only 1 core** no matter how many are available
- A multithreaded process can run each thread on a different core simultaneously

</div>

---

# Thread Benefits Summary Table

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Benefit | Key Explanation | Representative Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Responsiveness** | Program remains responsive during blocking | Web browser UI |
| **Resource Sharing** | Automatic resource sharing within the same address space | Global variable access |
| **Economy** | Creation/switching costs are lower than processes | Web server request handling |
| **Scalability** | Parallel execution on multicore systems | Video encoding, scientific computation |

> If a web server creates threads instead of processes per request, overhead is significantly reduced.

# Part 3
## Multicore Programming
### Silberschatz Ch 4.2

---

# Concurrency vs Parallelism

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Concurrency**
- Multiple tasks **making progress** at the same time
- Possible even on a single core — **interleaving** via time-sharing

```text
 Single core:  T1  T2  T3  T4  T1  T2  T3  T4  T1 ...
              ────────────────────────────────────▷ time
```

**Parallelism**
- Multiple tasks **actually executing simultaneously**
- Only possible on multi-core — each core runs a different thread

```text
 Core 1:  T1      T3      T1      T3      T1 ...
 Core 2:  T2      T4      T2      T4      T2 ...
         ────────────────────────────────────▷ time
```

> Concurrency without parallelism is possible, but parallelism without concurrency is not

</div>

---

# Single-Core vs Multi-Core Execution Comparison

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Single-core system (Figure 4.3)**:
- 4 threads: T1, T2, T3, T4
- Only one runs at a time → concurrency achieved through **interleaving**
- Not true parallelism

**Multi-core system (Figure 4.4)**:
- Core 1: alternates between T1 and T3
- Core 2: alternates between T2 and T4
- T1 and T2 run **simultaneously** → **true parallelism**

| Category | Single-core | Multi-core |
|------|------------|------------|
| Concurrency | O (interleaving) | O (parallel) |
| Parallelism | X | **O** |
| Performance gain | Time-sharing only | Actual throughput increase |

# Five Challenges of Multicore Programming

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Challenges that must be overcome to **effectively utilize** multicore systems:

**1. Identifying tasks**
- Find separable **independent** tasks
- Ideally, there should be no dependencies between tasks

**2. Balance**
- Distribute **equal workloads** to each core
- Assigning a separate core to a low-contribution task is inefficient

**3. Data splitting**
- **Split data appropriately** alongside tasks and distribute to each core
- Example: divide an array into N equal parts, each core handles one part

</div>

---

# Five Challenges of Multicore Programming (continued)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**4. Data dependency**
- If there are data dependencies between tasks, **synchronization** is required
- If Task B needs the result of Task A, their order must be guaranteed
- Covered in detail in Ch 6

**5. Testing and debugging**
- **Various execution paths** are possible during parallel execution
- **Non-deterministic** results can occur
- Bugs that are hard to reproduce (heisenbugs)

> Due to these challenges, many experts argue that the multicore era requires a **fundamentally new approach** to software design.

</div>

---

# Amdahl's Law

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

A law that expresses the limit of overall performance improvement when only **part of a system** is improved

$$
\text{speedup} \leq \frac{1}{S + \frac{1-S}{N}}
$$

- **S** = serial portion (fraction of serial execution)
- **N** = number of processing cores

Key meaning:
- Even as N approaches infinity, speedup converges to **1/S**
- The serial portion acts as the **bottleneck**

</div>

---

# Amdahl's Law — Numerical Examples

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| S (serial fraction) | N = 2 | N = 4 | N = 8 | N → ∞ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 5% | 1.90x | 3.48x | 5.93x | **20.00x** |
| 10% | 1.82x | 3.08x | 4.71x | **10.00x** |
| 25% | 1.60x | 2.28x | 3.02x | **4.00x** |
| 50% | 1.33x | 1.60x | 1.78x | **2.00x** |

Example:
- A program that is 75% parallel + 25% serial
  - 2 cores → **1.6x** speedup
  - 4 cores → **2.28x** speedup
  - No matter how many cores are added, the maximum is **4x** (= 1/0.25)

> The larger the serial fraction, the more **limited** the performance gain from adding cores.

</div>

---

# Amdahl's Law — Graph

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
Speedup
  16 ┤    ╱ Ideal (S=0)
     │   ╱

     0  2  4  6  8  10 12 14 16
              Number of Cores
```

- The smaller S is (the higher the parallelization ratio), the greater the effect of adding cores
- If S = 0.50, the maximum is 2x regardless of the number of cores

</div>

# Types of Parallelism

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Data Parallelism**
- Distribute the **same operation** across **subsets** of data
- Split the data; each core performs the same task
- Example: summing an array of size N
  - Core 0: sum elements [0] to [N/2-1]
  - Core 1: sum elements [N/2] to [N-1]

**Task Parallelism**
- Distribute **different operations (tasks)** to each thread
- Different tasks may operate on the same data
- Example: for an array
  - Core 0: compute the mean
  - Core 1: compute the standard deviation

</div>

# Data Parallelism vs Task Parallelism Comparison

| Category | Data Parallelism | Task Parallelism |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Data distribution | **Partitioned** and distributed | Same data possible |
| Operation type | **Identical** operations | **Different** operations |
| Scalability | Proportional to data size | Depends on the number of tasks |

# User Threads vs Kernel Threads

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
 ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
 │          User Space              │

```

**User Threads**:
- Managed by a user-level library (without kernel support)
- Examples: POSIX Pthreads, Windows threads, Java threads

**Kernel Threads**:
- **Directly managed** by the OS kernel
- Supported by virtually all modern OSes: Windows, Linux, macOS

> Key question: **How** should user threads be **mapped** to kernel threads?

</div>

# Part 5
## Multithreading Models
### Silberschatz Ch 4.3.1 – 4.3.3

---

# Many-to-One Model (Figure 4.7)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
 User Space:    ○  ○  ○  ○  ○
                 \ | /  | /
                  \|/   |/
 Kernel Space:    ●     (one kernel thread)
```

Multiple user threads mapped to **one** kernel thread

Advantages:
- Thread management is done in user space, making it **efficient**

Disadvantages:
- If one thread makes a **blocking system call** → **entire process blocks**
- **True parallelism is impossible** — the kernel can only schedule one thread at a time

Use cases:
- Former Solaris Green Threads
- Early Java (Green Threads)
- **Rarely used** in modern systems

</div>

---

# One-to-One Model (Figure 4.8)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
 User Space:    ○    ○    ○    ○
                |    |    |    |
 Kernel Space:  ●    ●    ●    ●
```

Each user thread mapped to **one** kernel thread

Advantages:
- Even if one thread blocks, **other threads can continue running**
- **True parallelism** achieved on multiprocessors

Disadvantages:
- Creating a user thread also **creates a kernel thread** → overhead
- Creating too many threads can **degrade system performance**

Use cases:
- Used by **Linux** and **Windows** operating systems
- The most widely used model today

</div>

---

# Many-to-Many Model (Figure 4.9)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
 User Space:    ○  ○  ○  ○  ○  ○
                 \ | X  | / |
                  \|/ \ |/  |
 Kernel Space:    ●    ●    ●
```

Multiple user threads mapped to an **equal or smaller number of** kernel threads

Advantages:
- Developers can create **as many** user threads as desired
- Kernel threads can execute **in parallel**
- If one thread blocks, the kernel can **schedule another thread**

Disadvantages:
- **Very complex to implement**

> Theoretically the most flexible, but in practice, one-to-one is dominant.

</div>

---

# Two-Level Model (Figure 4.10)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```text
 User Space:    ○  ○  ○  ○  ○  ○
                 \ | X  | /  |
                  \|/ \ |/   |    (bound)
 Kernel Space:    ●    ●     ●
```

**Many-to-Many** + **One-to-One** allowed

- Most user threads are managed via many-to-many
- Specific **important threads** can be **directly bound** to a kernel thread
  - Example: threads requiring real-time processing

> In practice, due to implementation complexity, one-to-one became the standard, and many-to-many is used internally by some concurrency libraries

</div>

# Multithreading Models Summary

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Model | Mapping | Advantages | Disadvantages | OS Used |
|------|-----|------|------|--------|
| Many-to-One | N:1 | Efficient management | Entire process blocks on blocking call, no parallelism | Former Solaris |
| **One-to-One** | 1:1 | High concurrency, parallel execution | Thread count limited (overhead) | **Linux, Windows** |
| Many-to-Many | N:M | Flexible, parallel + non-blocking | Complex implementation | Some libraries |
| Two-Level | N:M + 1:1 | Flexible + important thread binding | Complex implementation | Former Solaris, IRIX |

Key points:
- As processing cores increase, kernel thread limits become less significant
- Most modern OSes adopt the **one-to-one** model

# Part 6
## Thread Libraries
### Silberschatz Ch 4.4

---

# Thread Library Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Thread library** = provides an **API** for thread creation and management

Two implementation approaches:

**1. User-level library (user space)**
- All code and data structures reside in user space
- Library function call = **local function call** (not a system call)

**2. Kernel-level library (kernel space)**
- Code and data structures reside in kernel space
- Library function call = **system call**

Three major thread libraries:
1. **POSIX Pthreads** — user-level or kernel-level
2. **Windows Threads** — kernel-level
3. **Java Threads** — runs on JVM, uses the host OS's library

</div>

---

# Asynchronous vs Synchronous Threading

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Two main thread creation strategies:

**Asynchronous Threading**
- Parent thread creates a child thread and they run **independently**
- **Little to no data sharing** between parent and child
- Example: multithreaded web server — each request handled by an independent thread

**Synchronous Threading**
- Parent thread **waits for all child threads to finish (join)**
- Child threads **pass results** back to the parent upon completion
- **Significant data sharing** between tasks
- Example: parallel summation — the parent combines partial sums from each thread

> All examples in this chapter follow the **synchronous threading** pattern.

</div>

---

# Pthreads Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**POSIX Pthreads** = IEEE 1003.1c standard

> It is a **specification**, not an **implementation**
> OS designers are free to implement it however they choose

Key API functions:

| Function | Description |
|------|------|
| `pthread_create()` | Create a new thread |
| `pthread_join()` | Wait for a thread to terminate |
| `pthread_exit()` | Terminate the current thread |
| `pthread_attr_init()` | Initialize thread attributes |

Supported environments: UNIX, Linux, macOS
- Windows does not natively support it (third-party implementations exist)

</div>

---

# Pthreads Example — Integer Summation (Figure 4.11)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int sum;  /* global variable: data shared between threads */
void *runner(void *param);  /* function to be executed by the thread */

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    pthread_t tid;           /* thread identifier */
    pthread_attr_t attr;     /* thread attributes */

    pthread_attr_init(&attr);           /* initialize default attributes */
    pthread_create(&tid, &attr,         /* create the thread */
                   runner, argv[1]);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);            /* wait for the thread to finish */

    printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
}

void *runner(void *param)
{
    int i, upper = atoi(param);
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
        sum += i;
    pthread_exit(0);  /* terminate the thread */
}
```

</div>

---

# Pthreads Example — Code Analysis

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Execution flow** (input = 5):

1. In `main()`, `pthread_attr_init(&attr)` — set default attributes
2. `pthread_create(&tid, &attr, runner, argv[1])`
   - Create a new thread, begins execution in `runner("5")`
3. `pthread_join(tid, NULL)` — parent **waits** until the child finishes
4. Child thread (`runner`):
   - `upper = 5`, sum = 1+2+3+4+5 = **15**
   - Terminates with `pthread_exit(0)`
5. Parent: `printf("sum = %d\n", sum)` → outputs **"sum = 15"**

**Key points**:
- `sum` is a **global variable** → shared by all threads
- Without `pthread_join()`, the parent might terminate first
- `runner()` takes a `void *` parameter and returns `void *`

</div>

# Pthreads — Creating and Joining Multiple Threads

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Pattern for joining multiple threads (Figure 4.12)**:

```c
#define NUM_THREADS 10

pthread_t workers[NUM_THREADS];

/* create threads */
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++)
    pthread_create(&workers[i], NULL, task_func, &args[i]);

/* wait for all threads to finish */
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++)
    pthread_join(workers[i], NULL);
```

- The creation loop and join loop are **separated**
- All threads run **in parallel**, then are joined sequentially
- A pattern commonly used on multicore systems

</div>

---

# pthread_create() in Detail

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

```c
int pthread_create(
    pthread_t *thread,             /* variable to store the thread ID */
    const pthread_attr_t *attr,    /* thread attributes (NULL = default) */
    void *(*start_routine)(void*), /* function the thread will execute */
    void *arg                      /* argument passed to the function */
);
```

**Parameter descriptions**:

| Parameter | Role |
|---------|------|
| `thread` | Stores the ID of the newly created thread |
| `attr` | Stack size, scheduling info, etc. (defaults if NULL) |
| `start_routine` | Function pointer of the form `void *func(void *param)` |
| `arg` | Argument passed to start_routine (type void *) |

Return value: 0 on success, error number on failure

# Windows Threads Example (Figure 4.13)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```c
#include <windows.h>

    for (DWORD i = 1; i <= Upper; i++)
        Sum += i;
    return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    DWORD ThreadId;
    HANDLE ThreadHandle;
    int Param = atoi(argv[1]);

    ThreadHandle = CreateThread(
        NULL,        /* default security attributes */
        0,           /* default stack size */

        0,           /* default creation flags */
        &ThreadId);  /* returns the thread identifier */

    WaitForSingleObject(ThreadHandle, INFINITE);

# Java Thread Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

In Java, threads are the **fundamental model of program execution**
- Every Java program runs in at least one thread (the main thread)
- Runs on the **JVM** → uses the host OS's thread library
  - Windows → Windows API
  - Linux/macOS → Pthreads API

Two ways to create threads:

1. **Extend the Thread class** and override `run()`
2. **Implement the Runnable interface** (more common)

> The Runnable approach is recommended — since Java does not support multiple inheritance

</div>

---

# Java Thread — Runnable Interface

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Method 1: Implement the Runnable interface**

```java
class Task implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("I am a thread.");
    }
}

// Create and start the thread
Thread worker = new Thread(new Task());
worker.start();  // executes run() in a new thread
```

Role of the `start()` method:
1. **Allocates memory and initializes** a new thread in the JVM
2. Calls the `run()` method to make the **thread runnable**

> Note: Calling `run()` directly executes it in the **same thread**!
> You must call `start()` to create a new thread.

</div>

---

# Java Thread — Lambda Expression

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Method 2: Lambda expression (Java 8+)**

Runnable is a **functional interface** with only one abstract method → Lambdas can be used

```java
// Concise expression with Lambda
Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println("I am a thread.");
};

Thread worker = new Thread(task);
worker.start();
```

Even more concise:

```java
new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("I am a thread.");
}).start();
```

> Lambda expressions allow defining thread tasks inline without a separate class definition, making the **code more concise**.

</div>

---

# Java Thread — join()

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

To have the parent thread wait for a child thread to finish, use `join()`:

```java
Thread worker = new Thread(new Task());
worker.start();

try {
    worker.join();  // wait until the worker finishes
} catch (InterruptedException ie) {
    // handle interrupt during wait
}

System.out.println("Worker finished!");
```

**Pattern for joining multiple threads**:

```java
Thread[] workers = new Thread[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    workers[i] = new Thread(new Task());
    workers[i].start();
}
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    try { workers[i].join(); }
    catch (InterruptedException ie) { }
}
```

</div>

# Java Thread — Comparison with Pthreads/Windows

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Category | Pthreads (C) | Windows (C) | Java |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Creation | `pthread_create()` | `CreateThread()` | `new Thread().start()` |
| Wait | `pthread_join()` | `WaitForSingleObject()` | `thread.join()` |
| Termination | `pthread_exit()` | `return` / `ExitThread()` | `run()` returns |
| Shared data | Global variables | Global variables | **Object fields** (no global variables) |
| Result return | Difficult (`void *`) | Difficult | **Callable/Future** |

Java characteristics:
- **No concept of global data**
- Data sharing between threads is **explicitly set up through objects**
- The JVM internally uses the host OS's thread library

# Part 8
## Java Executor Framework
### Silberschatz Ch 4.4.3.1

---

# Java Executor Framework Overview

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Available since Java 5 in the `java.util.concurrent` package

**Executor interface**:
```java
public interface Executor {
    void execute(Runnable command);
}
```

Difference from the traditional approach:
```java
// Traditional: create threads directly
Thread t = new Thread(new Task());
t.start();

// Executor approach: separate thread creation from execution
Executor service = new SomeExecutor();
service.execute(new Task());
```

> **Producer-Consumer model**: produce tasks (Runnable), and threads consume and execute them

</div>

---

# Thread Pool Types

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Factory methods of the `Executors` class:

| Method | Description |
|--------|------|
| `newSingleThreadExecutor()` | Thread pool of size 1 — guarantees sequential execution |
| `newFixedThreadPool(int n)` | Maintains a fixed pool of n threads |
| `newCachedThreadPool()` | Creates threads as needed, **reuses** idle threads |

```java
// Fixed thread pool example
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    pool.execute(new Task());  // 100 tasks, processed by 4 threads
}

pool.shutdown();  // shut down the pool after all tasks complete
```

> Using a thread pool reduces thread creation/destruction costs and can **limit** the number of concurrent threads.

</div>

---

# Advantages of Thread Pools

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**1. Faster response by reusing existing threads**
- Saves the cost of creating threads each time
- Already existing threads immediately perform work

**2. Limiting the number of threads**
- Prevents excessive system resource usage
- Fixed pool: at most n threads run concurrently

**3. Separation of task and execution mechanism**
- Separates task definition (what to do) from execution strategy (how to execute)
- Enables various strategies such as deferred execution, periodic execution, etc.

> Pool size should be set considering **CPU count, memory, and expected concurrent requests**

</div>

---

# Callable and Future — Returning Results

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Problem**: Runnable's `run()` has no return value (`void`)

**Solution**: Use `Callable<V>` interface + `Future<V>`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class Summation implements Callable<Integer> {
    private int upper;

    public Summation(int upper) {
        this.upper = upper;
    }

    public Integer call() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
            sum += i;
        return new Integer(sum);
    }
}
```

- The `call()` method of `Callable` can **return a result**
- The returned result is received via a `Future` object

</div>

---

# Callable and Future — Complete Example (Figure 4.14)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class Summation implements Callable<Integer> {
    private int upper;
    public Summation(int upper) { this.upper = upper; }

    public Integer call() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
            sum += i;
        return new Integer(sum);
    }
}

public class Driver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int upper = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        ExecutorService pool =
            Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<Integer> result =
            pool.submit(new Summation(upper));

        try {
            System.out.println("sum = " + result.get());
        } catch (InterruptedException |
                 ExecutionException ie) { }
    }
}
```

- `submit()` → submits the task and returns a **Future**
- `result.get()` → **blocks** until the result is ready

</div>

---

# execute() vs submit()

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Method | Parameter | Return Value | Use Case |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| `execute(Runnable)` | Runnable | None (`void`) | Tasks that do not need a result |
| `submit(Callable)` | Callable | `Future<V>` | Tasks that **need a result** |
| `submit(Runnable)` | Runnable | `Future<?>` | Only check completion status |

**Thread Pool Example (Figure 4.15)**:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numTasks = Integer.parseInt(args[0].trim());
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

        for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; i++)
            pool.execute(new Task());

        pool.shutdown();  // reject new tasks, shut down after existing ones complete
    }
}
```

- The JVM specification does not prescribe **how Java threads are mapped** to the OS
- It varies by implementation:
  - **Windows**: one-to-one model → each Java thread maps to a kernel thread
  - **Linux/macOS**: mapped using the Pthreads API
- As a result, Java threads are also managed by the **OS scheduler**

# Lab Overview: Splitting Array Summation Across Multiple Threads

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Goal**: Divide the summation of a 1000-element array across 4 threads

**Applying Data Parallelism**:
- Thread 0: sum elements [0] to [249]
- Thread 1: sum elements [250] to [499]
- Thread 2: sum elements [500] to [749]
- Thread 3: sum elements [750] to [999]

```text
 Array: [  0 ~ 249  |  250 ~ 499  |  500 ~ 749  |  750 ~ 999  ]
            ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓
        Thread 0      Thread 1       Thread 2       Thread 3
        partial[0]    partial[1]     partial[2]     partial[3]

# Lab: Thread Function Implementation

#include <stdio.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 4
#define ARRAY_SIZE  1000

int array[ARRAY_SIZE];
int partial_sum[NUM_THREADS];

void *sum_array(void *arg)
{
    int id    = *(int *)arg;
    int chunk = ARRAY_SIZE / NUM_THREADS;

    printf("Thread %d: partial_sum = %d\n",
           id, partial_sum[id]);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

- Each thread handles a **different segment** of the array based on its `id`
- Results are stored in `partial_sum[id]` (a **separate index** per thread)

# Lab: Code Analysis

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Execution flow**:
1. `array[i] = i + 1` → [1, 2, 3, ..., 1000]
2. 4 threads are created, each responsible for 250 elements
3. Thread 0: 1+2+...+250 = 31375
4. Thread 1: 251+252+...+500 = 93875
5. Thread 2: 501+502+...+750 = 156375
6. Thread 3: 751+752+...+1000 = 218875
7. `pthread_join()` waits for all threads to complete
8. Total = 31375 + 93875 + 156375 + 218875 = **500500**

**Compilation and execution**:
```text
gcc -pthread lab_sum.c -o lab_sum

# Lab: Why the thread_ids Array Is Necessary

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Incorrect code** (a common mistake):
```c
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL,
                   sum_array, &i);  /* Dangerous! */
}
```

**The problem**:
- All threads share the **same address of variable `i`**
- By the time a thread executes, the value of `i` may have already changed
- Example: all 4 threads might read `id = 4`

**Correct code**:
```c
int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS];
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
    thread_ids[i] = i;  /* separate variable for each thread */
    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL,
                   sum_array, &thread_ids[i]);
}
```

# Lab: Observing a Race Condition

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

What if all threads share **a single global variable** instead of `partial_sum[id]`?

```c
int global_sum = 0;  /* shared by all threads */

void *sum_array_bad(void *arg) {
    int id    = *(int *)arg;
    int start = id * (ARRAY_SIZE / NUM_THREADS);
    int end   = start + (ARRAY_SIZE / NUM_THREADS);

    for (int i = start; i < end; i++)
        global_sum += array[i];  /* Race condition! */

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

**Race condition** occurs:
- `global_sum += array[i]` is a read-modify-write 3-step operation
- When multiple threads execute it simultaneously, **values can be lost**
- Running it multiple times may produce **different results**

# Lab: Integer Summation with Pthreads (Textbook Example Variant)

<div class="text-left text-sm">

Summing integers received as a command-line argument:

#include <stdlib.h>

int sum = 0;

    int upper = atoi(param);
    for (int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
        sum += i;
    pthread_exit(0);

    pthread_create(&tid, &attr, runner, argv[1]);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

Execution: `./a.out 10` → "sum = 55"

</div>

# Lab Key Takeaways

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Basic Pthreads pattern**:
1. `pthread_attr_init()` — initialize attributes (defaults are fine)
2. `pthread_create()` — create a thread (function pointer + argument)
3. Perform work in the thread function (share results via global variables)
4. `pthread_join()` — wait for termination
5. Collect and print results

**Important notes**:
- Use **separate variables** when passing arguments to thread functions (to prevent race conditions)
- **Synchronization** is needed when accessing shared variables (avoided in this lab by using separate indices)
- The `-pthread` flag is required at compile time
