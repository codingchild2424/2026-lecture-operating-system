# Week 09 — Synchronization

## Overview
- **Textbook**: Silberschatz Ch 6 (Synchronization Tools) review/advanced
- **xv6 Reference**: Ch 7.5–7.7 (sleep/wakeup, pipe)
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Understand the sleep/wakeup mechanism at the xv6 code level
  - Analyze pipe implementation as a real-world synchronization example
  - Introduce the final project
