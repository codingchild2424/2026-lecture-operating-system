# Part 2. What is an Operating System?

A Big-Picture Overview

---

# What is an Operating System?

- The **one program running at all times** on the computer = **Kernel**
- Everything else is either a **system program** or an **application program**

<br>

**OS is like a government:**
> It does not perform useful functions by itself, but provides an **environment** in which other programs can do useful work.

---

# Where the OS Sits

<img src="./images/ch01_p02-02.png" class="h-72 mx-auto" />

<p class="text-xs text-gray-500 text-center">Silberschatz, Figure 1.1 — Abstract view of the components of a computer system</p>

- The OS sits **between** hardware and applications
- It directly controls hardware and provides a **clean interface** to programs

---

# Two Roles of the OS

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-4">
<div class="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4">

### Resource Allocator

Manages and distributes **limited resources** efficiently and fairly:

- **CPU time** — which process runs when
- **Memory space** — allocation to each process
- **Storage & I/O** — disk access, device sharing

</div>
<div class="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">

### Control Program

Controls execution of user programs, prevents errors and misuse:

- **Manage execution** — start, stop, schedule programs
- **Prevent errors** — catch illegal operations
- **Enforce isolation** — protect processes from each other

</div>
</div>

---

# How Does the OS Protect Itself?

**Dual-Mode Operation**

```mermaid
graph LR
    UP["User Program<br/>(user mode)"] -->|"system call<br/>(trap)"| KM["Kernel<br/>(kernel mode)"]
    KM -->|"return"| UP
    KM --> PI["Full hardware access<br/>Privileged instructions"]
    UP --> RI["Restricted access<br/>No direct I/O"]
    style UP fill:#e3f2fd
    style KM fill:#fff3e0
    style PI fill:#c8e6c9
    style RI fill:#ffcdd2
```

| Mode | Mode bit | Who runs here |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Kernel mode** | 0 | OS kernel — full hardware access |
| **User mode** | 1 | Applications — restricted access |

---

# System Calls — The OS API

<img src="./images/ch02_p11-11.png" class="h-64 mx-auto" />

<p class="text-xs text-gray-500 text-center">Silberschatz, Figure 2.6 — The handling of a user application invoking the open() system call</p>

- **System call** = the only way for user programs to request OS services
- User program → C library → `syscall` instruction (trap) → kernel handles it → return
- Even a simple `cp in.txt out.txt` triggers **thousands** of system calls

---

    style DC2 fill:#e8f5e9
    style DC3 fill:#e8f5e9
```

- Devices signal completion via **interrupts**
- **DMA** (Direct Memory Access): bulk data transfer without CPU intervention

| Level | Size | Access Time | Managed by |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Registers** | < 1 KB | ~0.3 ns | Hardware |
| **Cache (L1/L2)** | < 64 MB | ~1–25 ns | Hardware |
| **Main Memory** | < 64 GB | ~100 ns | **OS** |
| **SSD** | < 4 TB | ~50 us | **OS** |
| **HDD** | < 20 TB | ~5 ms | **OS** |

# OS Structures

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-2">

| Structure | Key Idea | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Monolithic** | Everything in one kernel binary | Linux, traditional UNIX |
| **Microkernel** | Minimal kernel + user-space services | Mach, QNX |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of both | macOS (Mach + BSD), Windows |
| **Loadable Modules** | Core kernel + dynamic modules | Linux (LKM) |

Most modern OSes are **hybrid** — pragmatic, not pure.

# What We'll Use: xv6

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-2">

- **xv6**: A simple, Unix-like teaching OS by MIT
- Written in **C** for **RISC-V** architecture
- ~10,000 lines of code — small enough to read entirely
- Implements: processes, virtual memory, file system, shell
- We'll **read, modify, and extend** xv6 throughout the semester

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv
cd xv6-riscv
make qemu    # Boot xv6 in QEMU emulator
```

# Part 3. Semester Preview

A taste of what's coming in each topic area

---

# Preview: Process (Week 2–3)

A **process** = a program in execution, with its own memory and state

```mermaid
graph LR
    NEW["New"] -->|"admitted"| READY["Ready"]
    READY -->|"dispatch"| RUN["Running"]
    RUN -->|"interrupt"| READY
    RUN -->|"I/O wait"| WAIT["Waiting"]
    WAIT -->|"I/O done"| READY
    RUN -->|"exit"| TERM["Terminated"]
    style NEW fill:#e3f2fd
    style READY fill:#c8e6c9
    style RUN fill:#fff3e0
    style WAIT fill:#fce4ec
    style TERM fill:#eeeeee
```

- Key system calls: **`fork()`**, **`exec()`**, **`wait()`**, **`exit()`**
- `fork()` creates a **copy** of the current process (parent → child)
- `exec()` **replaces** the process image with a new program
- In xv6: `kernel/proc.c` — the process table and state transitions

---

# Preview: Threads & Concurrency (Week 4–5)

A **thread** = a lightweight execution unit that shares its process's address space

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Single-threaded Process"
        P1["Process"] --> T1["Thread"]
        T1 --> CS1["Code + Data + Files"]
    end
    subgraph "Multi-threaded Process"
        P2["Process"] --> T2["Thread 1"]
        P2 --> T3["Thread 2"]
        P2 --> T4["Thread 3"]
        T2 --> CS2["Shared:<br/>Code + Data + Files"]
        T3 --> CS2
        T4 --> CS2
    end
    style P1 fill:#e3f2fd
    style P2 fill:#e3f2fd
    style CS1 fill:#c8e6c9
    style CS2 fill:#c8e6c9
```

- Multiple threads in one process → **parallelism** on multi-core CPUs
- Challenge: **race conditions** when threads access shared data simultaneously

---

# Preview: CPU Scheduling (Week 6–7)

The OS decides **which process runs next** on the CPU

```mermaid
graph LR
    RQ["Ready Queue<br/>P1 · P2 · P3 · P4"] -->|"schedule"| CPU["CPU<br/>(running P1)"]
    CPU -->|"preempt /<br/>I/O wait"| RQ
    CPU -->|"finished"| DONE["Terminated"]
    style RQ fill:#e3f2fd
    style CPU fill:#fff3e0
    style DONE fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Scheduling algorithms** balance competing goals:

| Algorithm | Idea | Trade-off |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **FCFS** | First come, first served | Simple but convoy effect |
| **SJF** | Shortest job first | Optimal avg wait, hard to predict |
| **Round Robin** | Fixed time slice, rotate | Fair, good response time |
| **Priority** | Highest priority first | Risk of starvation |

---

# Preview: Synchronization (Week 9)

When multiple threads share data, we need **coordination**

```mermaid
graph TD
    T1["Thread A:<br/>balance = balance + 100"] --> CS["Shared Variable<br/>balance = 1000"]
    T2["Thread B:<br/>balance = balance - 50"] --> CS
    CS --> R1["Expected: 1050"]
    CS --> R2["Race condition: 950 ❌"]
    style CS fill:#fff3e0
    style R1 fill:#c8e6c9
    style R2 fill:#ffcdd2
```

- **Critical section**: code that accesses shared resources
- **Locks** (mutexes): ensure only one thread enters at a time
- **Semaphores** and **condition variables**: more flexible coordination
- Classic problems: Producer-Consumer, Readers-Writers, Dining Philosophers

---

# Preview: Deadlocks (Week 10)

**Deadlock** = two or more processes each waiting for the other to release a resource

```mermaid
graph LR
    T1["Thread 1"] -->|"holds"| LA["Lock A"]
    T1 -->|"wants"| LB["Lock B"]
    T2["Thread 2"] -->|"holds"| LB
    T2 -->|"wants"| LA
    style T1 fill:#ffcdd2
    style T2 fill:#ffcdd2
    style LA fill:#fff3e0
    style LB fill:#fff3e0
```

**Four conditions** (all must hold): Mutual exclusion · Hold and wait · No preemption · **Circular wait**

**Solutions**: Lock ordering · `trylock` + back-off · Deadlock detection & recovery

---

# Preview: Memory Management (Week 11–12)

**Virtual memory** gives each process its own private address space

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Process A"
        VA_A["Virtual Addr<br/>0x1000"]
    end
    subgraph "Process B"
        VA_B["Virtual Addr<br/>0x1000"]
    end
    VA_A -->|"Page Table A"| PA1["Physical<br/>0x5A000"]
    VA_B -->|"Page Table B"| PA2["Physical<br/>0x8B000"]
    style VA_A fill:#e3f2fd
    style VA_B fill:#e3f2fd
    style PA1 fill:#c8e6c9
    style PA2 fill:#fff3e0
```

- Same virtual address → **different** physical locations (isolation!)
- **Page table**: per-process mapping from virtual pages to physical frames
- Enables **COW fork**, **lazy allocation**, **memory-mapped files**
- In xv6: RISC-V **Sv39** — 3-level page table, 39-bit virtual addresses

---

# Preview: File System & Security (Week 13–14)

**File system** organizes persistent data in layers

| Layer | Component | Key Functions |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 6 | **File Descriptors** | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` |
| 5 | **Pathnames** | `namei()` — resolve `/path/to/file` |
| 4 | **Directories** | `dirlookup()`, `dirlink()` |
| 3 | **Inodes** | `ialloc()`, `readi()`, `writei()` |
| 2 | **Logging** | Crash safety via write-ahead log |
| 1 | **Buffer Cache** | `bread()`, `bwrite()` — cache disk blocks |
| 0 | **Disk** | Physical block device |

- Each layer relies **only** on the layer below — clean, modular design
- **Security** (Week 14): Protection rings, access control, encryption
