# Part 1
## System Model

---

# Chapter Objectives

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Topics covered in this chapter:

- Understand how deadlock arises when using mutex locks
- Define the 4 necessary conditions that characterize deadlock
- Identify deadlock situations in a Resource-Allocation Graph
- Evaluate 4 approaches for deadlock prevention
- Apply the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance
- Apply the deadlock detection algorithm
- Evaluate approaches for deadlock recovery

</div>

# System Model

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

A system consists of a finite number of resources

- **Resource types**: R1, R2, ..., Rm
  - CPU cycles, memory, I/O devices, files, mutex locks, semaphores, etc.
- Each resource type Ri has Wi **instances**
  - Example: If the system has 3 printers, R_printer has instances = 3

</div>

---

# Resource Usage Sequence

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

The normal sequence for a thread using a resource:

1. **Request** — Request the resource (wait if not immediately available)
2. **Use** — Use the resource (print, read a file, etc.)
3. **Release** — Release the resource

</div>

System call examples:

| Operation | System Calls |
|-----------|-------------|
| Device | `request()` / `release()` |
| File | `open()` / `close()` |
| Memory | `allocate()` / `free()` |
| Semaphore | `wait()` / `signal()` |
| Mutex | `acquire()` / `release()` |

---

# Definition of Deadlock

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Deadlock**: A state in which every thread in a set is waiting for an event that can only be caused by another thread in the same set

</div>

```text
Example:
  T1 holds resource A, waits for resource B
  T2 holds resource B, waits for resource A
  → Both threads can never make progress
```

Kansas law: "When two trains meet at a crossing, both shall come to a full stop, and neither shall start until the other has gone" — A logically impossible situation!

---

# Deadlock in Multithreaded Applications

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

An example of acquiring two mutex locks in different orders:

</div>

```c
pthread_mutex_t first_mutex;
pthread_mutex_t second_mutex;

/* thread_one */
void *do_work_one(void *param) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&first_mutex);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&second_mutex);
    /* Do some work */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&second_mutex);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);
    pthread_exit(0);
}

/* thread_two */
void *do_work_two(void *param) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&second_mutex);   // Opposite order!
    pthread_mutex_lock(&first_mutex);
    /* Do some work */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&second_mutex);
    pthread_exit(0);
}
```

---

# Deadlock Occurrence Scenario

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

An execution sequence where deadlock occurs in the previous code:

</div>

```text
Time 1: thread_one acquires first_mutex
        → first_mutex: locked by T1

Time 2: thread_two acquires second_mutex
        → second_mutex: locked by T2

Time 3: thread_one requests second_mutex → blocked!
        (held by T2)

Time 4: thread_two requests first_mutex → blocked!
        (held by T1)

Result: Both threads wait forever → Deadlock!
```

Note: Deadlock does not always occur — it depends on CPU scheduling

---

# Livelock

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Livelock**: A state where threads continuously change state but make no actual progress

- Unlike deadlock, threads are not in a blocked state
- They keep retrying but never succeed

</div>

```c
/* thread_one — using trylock */
void *do_work_one(void *param) {
    int done = 0;
    while (!done) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&first_mutex);
        if (pthread_mutex_trylock(&second_mutex)) {
            /* Do some work */
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&second_mutex);
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);
            done = 1;
        } else
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);  // Release and retry
    }
    pthread_exit(0);
}
```

Solution: random backoff — randomize the retry interval (same as Ethernet collision resolution)

# Part 2
## Deadlock Characterization

# Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

All four of the following conditions must hold **simultaneously** for deadlock to occur:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** — At least one resource is held in a nonsharable mode
2. **Hold and Wait** — A thread holds at least one resource while waiting for additional resources
3. **No Preemption** — Resources can only be released voluntarily by the thread holding them
4. **Circular Wait** — A circular chain of waiting exists: T0→T1→T2→...→Tn→T0

</div>

All four conditions must be satisfied for deadlock to occur; circular wait implies hold and wait

---

# Four Necessary Conditions — Detailed Explanation

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**1. Mutual Exclusion** — At least one resource is held in a nonsharable mode. Example: mutex lock

**2. Hold and Wait** — A thread holds at least one resource while requesting additional resources and waiting. Example: T1 holds disk and requests printer

**3. No Preemption** — Resources can only be released voluntarily by the thread holding them; forced reclamation is not possible. Example: mutex lock

**4. Circular Wait** — In {T0, T1, ..., Tn}, a circular wait exists: T0→T1→...→Tn→T0

</div>

```text
  Circular Wait example:
    T0 ──(waits for R1)──→ T1
     ↑                       │
    (waits for R3)     (waits for R2)
     │                       ↓
    T2 ←──(holds R2)────── T1
```

---

# Resource-Allocation Graph (RAG)

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Represents the resource allocation state of the system as a directed graph

**Components:**
- **Thread**: Circle (Ti)
- **Resource type**: Rectangle (Rj), dots inside = number of instances
- **Request edge**: Ti → Rj (thread requests a resource, waiting)
- **Assignment edge**: Rj → Ti (a resource instance is assigned to the thread)

</div>

```text
  Request edge:    Ti ──→ Rj   (Ti requests Rj)
  Assignment edge: Rj ──→ Ti   (Rj is assigned to Ti)
```

---

# RAG — Example (No Deadlock)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Represent the following state as a resource-allocation graph:

</div>

```text
  T = {T1, T2, T3}
  R = {R1(1), R2(2), R3(1), R4(3)}

       ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
       │ R1  │         │ R3  │
       │  ●  │         │  ●  │
       └──┬──┘         └──┬──┘
     ↗    ↓               ↓
  (T1)   (T2)  ←──────  (T3)
     ↖    ↑
       └──┴──┐
       │ R2  │         ┌─────┐
       │ ● ● │         │ R4  │
       └─────┘         │●●●  │
                        └─────┘

  T1: holds R2, waiting for R1
  T2: holds R1, R2, waiting for R3
  T3: holds R3
```

In this state, if T3 releases R3 then T2 can proceed → **No Deadlock**

---

# RAG — Example (Deadlock)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

If T3 additionally requests R2 from the previous state:

</div>

```text
       ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
       │ R1  │         │ R3  │
       │  ●  │         │  ●  │
       └──┬──┘         └──┬──┘
     ↗    ↓               ↓
  (T1)   (T2)  ←──────  (T3)
     ↖    ↑               ↑
       └──┴──┐            │
       │ R2  │────────────┘
       │ ● ● │   T3→R2 (request)
       └─────┘

  Two cycles occur:
    T1 → R1 → T2 → R3 → T3 → R2 → T1
    T2 → R3 → T3 → R2 → T2

  → Deadlock!
```

# RAG — Relationship Between Cycle and Deadlock

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Cycle and Deadlock:**

| Situation | Conclusion |
|-----------|-----------|
| No cycle | No deadlock (necessary condition not met) |
| Cycle exists + each resource has 1 instance | **Definitely** deadlock |
| Cycle exists + resources have multiple instances | Deadlock is **possible** (but not guaranteed) |

</div>

```text
  Example with cycle but no deadlock:

       ┌─────┐
       │ R1  │
       │  ●  │           If T4 releases R2
       └──┬──┘           T3 can proceed
     ↗    ↓              → cycle is broken
  (T1)   (T3)
     ↖               (T2)  (T4)
       └──┴──┐        ↑     ↑

# Part 3
## Methods for Handling Deadlocks

---

# Deadlock Handling Methods — 3 Approaches

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

1. **Deadlock Prevention** — Ensure that at least one of the 4 necessary conditions cannot hold
2. **Deadlock Avoidance** — Use additional information to prevent entering an unsafe state
3. **Deadlock Detection & Recovery** — Allow deadlock to occur, then detect and recover

</div>

Other:
- **Deadlock Ignorance (Ostrich Algorithm)** — Ignore deadlock
  - Adopted by most operating systems (Linux, Windows)
  - Cost-benefit: Since deadlock occurs rarely, the cost of prevention may be greater
  - Kernel/application developers handle it directly

---

# Comparison of Deadlock Handling Methods

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Method | Core Idea | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Prevention** | Eliminate necessary conditions | Guaranteed prevention | Reduced resource utilization/throughput |
| **Avoidance** | Maintain safe state | More flexible than prevention | Requires advance information, overhead |
| **Detection & Recovery** | Respond after occurrence | High resource utilization | Detection overhead, recovery cost |
| **Ignorance** | Ignore | Lowest overhead | Manual intervention needed on deadlock |

</div>

In practice, systems may combine different methods for different resource types

# Part 4
## Deadlock Prevention

---

# Prevention — Breaking Mutual Exclusion

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Eliminating the Mutual Exclusion condition:**

- Sharable resources do not require mutual exclusion
  - Example: Read-only files can be accessed simultaneously
  - If multiple threads only read, deadlock cannot occur

- However, resources like mutex locks and semaphores are **inherently nonsharable**
  - Cannot be applied to such resources

Conclusion: **Generally difficult to apply**

</div>

---

# Prevention — Breaking Hold and Wait

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Eliminating the Hold and Wait condition:**

**Method 1** — Request **all needed resources at once** before execution begins

**Method 2** — Only request new resources when holding no resources at all
- Release all currently held resources before making new requests

</div>

```text
Method 2 example:
  A thread reads a file from disk, sorts it, then prints via printer

  Phase 1: Request disk → read file → release disk
  Phase 2: Request printer → print → release printer

  (disk and printer are never held simultaneously)
```

Disadvantage: Low resource utilization, possible starvation

---

# Prevention — Breaking No Preemption

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Eliminating the No Preemption condition:**

**Protocol 1:**
- If a thread's resource request is not immediately fulfilled, **release all currently held resources**
- Restart when both previous and new resources can be acquired

**Protocol 2:**
- If the requested resource is held by another **waiting thread**, preempt it from that thread
- If held by a non-waiting thread, the requesting thread waits

</div>

**Applicable resources**: Resources whose state can be easily saved/restored (CPU registers, memory, etc.)

**Not applicable**: Mutex locks, semaphores (difficult to save/restore state)

---

# Prevention — Breaking Circular Wait

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**The most practical prevention technique!**

Impose a **total ordering** on all resource types:

F: R → N (assign a unique integer to each resource)

Each thread must request resources **only in ascending order**

</div>

```text
F(first_mutex) = 1
F(second_mutex) = 5

// Correct — ascending F values
lock(first_mutex);      // F = 1
lock(second_mutex);     // F = 5 (1 < 5, OK)

// Violation (prohibited)
lock(second_mutex);     // F = 5
lock(first_mutex);      // F = 1 (5 > 1, violation!)
```

---

# Circular Wait Prevention — Proof

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Proof (by contradiction):**

Assume circular wait exists: T0 → T1 → ... → Tn → T0

- Since Ti+1 holds Ri and requests Ri+1: F(Ri) < F(Ri+1)
- Therefore: F(R0) < F(R1) < ... < F(Rn) < F(R0)
- This implies F(R0) < F(R0), which is a **contradiction**
- Therefore, circular wait cannot occur

**Note:**
- Defining a lock ordering alone is not sufficient — programmers **must adhere to it**
- In Java, `System.identityHashCode(Object)` is sometimes used as the ordering function

</div>

---

# Pitfall of Lock Ordering — Dynamic Locks

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

When locks are determined dynamically, ordering becomes difficult:

</div>

```c
void transaction(Account from, Account to, double amount) {
    mutex lock1, lock2;
    lock1 = get_lock(from);
    lock2 = get_lock(to);

    acquire(lock1);     // lock for 'from' account
    acquire(lock2);     // lock for 'to' account

    withdraw(from, amount);
    deposit(to, amount);

    release(lock2);
    release(lock1);
}
```

```text
Thread A: transaction(checking, savings, 25.0)
          → lock(checking) → lock(savings)

Thread B: transaction(savings, checking, 50.0)
          → lock(savings) → lock(checking)

→ Deadlock possible!
```

Solution: Compare lock addresses and always acquire the lock with the lower address first

---

# Linux lockdep Tool

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**lockdep**: A lock order verification tool in the Linux kernel

- Dynamically tracks lock acquire/release patterns during kernel execution
- Reports warnings when lock ordering violations are detected

**Key detection capabilities:**

1. **Order violation detection** — Reports when locks are acquired in incorrect order
2. **Interrupt handler deadlock detection** — Warns when a spinlock used in an interrupt handler is acquired without disabling interrupts

**Characteristics:**
- For development/testing environments only (disabled in production due to performance overhead)
- Since its introduction in 2006, deadlock reports decreased by 10x
- Recently applicable to user application Pthreads mutex locks as well

</div>

# Prevention Methods Summary

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Condition | Prevention Strategy | Practicality |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Mutual Exclusion** | Use sharable resources | Not applicable to most resources |
| **Hold and Wait** | Request all resources at once or request only when holding none | Low resource utilization, starvation |
| **No Preemption** | Force resource release | Only applicable to CPU registers, etc. |
| **Circular Wait** | Order resources, request in ascending order | **Most practical** |

# Part 5
## Deadlock Avoidance

---

# Deadlock Avoidance — Overview

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Limitations of Prevention:** Reduced resource utilization and system throughput

**Idea behind Avoidance:**
- Each thread declares in advance its **maximum resource requirement**
- The system considers the **future** when making allocation decisions
- Even if resources are available, allocation is denied if it leads to an unsafe state

**Key concepts:**
- **Safe State**: A state in which a sequence exists that allows all threads to complete
- **Unsafe State**: A state in which deadlock **may** occur

</div>

---

# Safe State and Safe Sequence

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Safe State**: A state in which the system has a safe sequence

**Safe Sequence** <T1, T2, ..., Tn>:
- Each Ti's resource demand can be satisfied by "currently available resources + resources to be returned by all Tj before Ti"
- That is, even if Ti's needed resources are not immediately available, they can be obtained once Tj (j < i) completes

</div>

Safe → Deadlock absolutely impossible / Unsafe → Deadlock possible (but not guaranteed)

---

# Safe State Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

12 resources, 3 threads

| Thread | Maximum Need | Current Allocation |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| T0 | 10 | 5 |
| T1 | 4 | 2 |
| T2 | 9 | 2 |

**Available** = 12 - (5 + 2 + 2) = **3**

</div>

```text
Safe sequence: <T1, T0, T2>

  T1: Need = 4-2 = 2, Available = 3 >= 2
      → Execute and release → Available = 3+2 = 5

  T0: Need = 10-5 = 5, Available = 5 >= 5
      → Execute and release → Available = 5+5 = 10

  T2: Need = 9-2 = 7, Available = 10 >= 7
      → Execute and release → Available = 10+2 = 12

  All threads can complete → Safe State!
```

---

# Safe → Unsafe Transition Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

If we allocate 1 additional resource to T2 from the previous state:

| Thread | Maximum Need | Current Allocation |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| T0 | 10 | 5 |
| T1 | 4 | 2 |
| T2 | 9 | **3** |

**Available** = 12 - (5 + 2 + 3) = **2**

</div>

```text
  Only T1 can run: Need = 2, Available = 2 >= 2
      → Execute and release → Available = 2+2 = 4

  T0: Need = 5, Available = 4 < 5 → Cannot run!
  T2: Need = 6, Available = 4 < 6 → Cannot run!

  → No sequence can complete all threads → Unsafe State!
```

Should not have allocated the resource to T2 → **The essence of Avoidance**

---

# Resource-Allocation-Graph Algorithm

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Used when each resource type has only **1 instance**

Add **Claim edge (dashed line)** to the existing RAG: Ti ···> Rj

- Claim edge: Ti **may** request Rj in the future (declared in advance)
- On resource request: Claim edge → Request edge
- On resource allocation: Request edge → Assignment edge
- On resource release: Assignment edge → Claim edge (restored)

</div>

**Allocation rule:** If converting a request edge to an assignment edge would create a **cycle, deny the allocation**

Cycle detection: O(n^2) — n is the number of threads

---

# RAG Algorithm — Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

</div>

```text
  Initial state:
       ┌────┐
       │ R1 │
       │ ●  │
       └────┘
      ↗      ╲ (claim, dashed)
  (T1)        (T2)
      ╲          ↗
   (claim)  ┌────┐
            │ R2 │
            │ ●  │
            └────┘

  What if T2 requests R2?

  Converting to R2 → T2 (assignment):
  T1 ···> R2 → T2 ···> R1 → T1  ← cycle formed!

  → Allocation denied! (would result in unsafe state)
```

If T1 requests R2 and T2 requests R1 → deadlock

---

# Banker's Algorithm — Overview

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

The RAG Algorithm cannot be applied when resource instances are **more than one**

**Banker's Algorithm:**
- Based on the principle that a bank never lends cash in a way that it cannot satisfy all customers' demands
- Each thread declares its **maximum usage for each resource type** upon entering the system
- On resource request, check whether the system remains in a safe state after allocation
- If safe, allocate; if unsafe, wait

</div>

---

# Banker's Algorithm — Data Structures

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

n = number of threads, m = number of resource types

</div>

```text
Available[m]
  Available[j] = k → resource type Rj has k available instances

Max[n][m]
  Max[i][j] = k → thread Ti may request up to k instances of Rj

Allocation[n][m]
  Allocation[i][j] = k → Ti currently has k instances of Rj allocated

Need[n][m]
  Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]
  Additional instances of Rj that Ti may need
```

**Vector comparison**: X <= Y iff for all i, X[i] <= Y[i]

# Safety Algorithm

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Algorithm to determine whether the current state is safe:

</div>

```text
1. Work[m] = Available
   Finish[n] = false (for all i)

2. Find an i such that:
   (a) Finish[i] == false
   (b) Need_i <= Work

   If no such i exists, go to step 4

3. Work = Work + Allocation_i
   Finish[i] = true
   Go back to step 2

4. If Finish[i] == true for all i → Safe State
   Otherwise → Unsafe State
```

**Time complexity:** O(m x n^2)

---

# Resource-Request Algorithm

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

When thread Ti makes a request Request_i:

</div>

```text
1. Check if Request_i <= Need_i
   If not → error (exceeds maximum claim)

2. Check if Request_i <= Available
   If not → Ti must wait (insufficient resources)

3. Perform pretend allocation:
   Available   = Available - Request_i
   Allocation_i = Allocation_i + Request_i
   Need_i      = Need_i - Request_i

4. Run Safety Algorithm:
   Safe   → Confirm allocation
   Unsafe → Cancel allocation, Ti waits
             (restore state before pretend allocation)
```

# Banker's Algorithm — Request Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

From the previous state, T1 requests Request_1 = (1, 0, 2)

</div>

```text
Check 1: Request(1,0,2) <= Need[1](1,2,2)? → Yes
Check 2: Request(1,0,2) <= Available(3,3,2)? → Yes

Pretend allocation:
  Available    = (3,3,2) - (1,0,2) = (2,3,0)
  Allocation[1] = (2,0,0) + (1,0,2) = (3,0,2)
  Need[1]      = (1,2,2) - (1,0,2) = (0,2,0)
```

```text
Safety Check (new state):

  T3: Need(0,1,1) <= (5,3,2) → Work = (7,4,3)

# Banker's Algorithm — Denied Requests

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

After T1's request is approved, in the resulting state:

**If T4 requests (3, 3, 0)?**
- Request(3,3,0) <= Available(2,3,0)? → **No** (3 > 2)
- Insufficient resources, **must wait**

**If T0 requests (0, 2, 0)?**
- Request(0,2,0) <= Need[0](7,4,3)? → Yes
- Request(0,2,0) <= Available(2,3,0)? → Yes
- Pretend allocation: Available = (2,1,0), Allocation[0] = (0,3,0), Need[0] = (7,2,3)
- Safety check → **Unsafe!** → Allocation denied, T0 waits

</div>

Even if resources are available, allocation is denied if it leads to an unsafe state!

# Part 6
## Deadlock Detection

---

# Deadlock Detection — Overview

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

When Prevention/Avoidance is not used:
- Allow deadlock to occur
- Periodically check for deadlock using a **detection algorithm**
- If deadlock is detected, perform **recovery**

Two cases:
1. Each resource type has **1 instance** → Wait-for Graph
2. Each resource type has **multiple instances** → Detection Algorithm

</div>

---

# Detection — Single Instance (Wait-for Graph)

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

When each resource type has 1 instance:

**Wait-for Graph:**
- **Remove resource nodes** from the Resource-Allocation Graph
- Ti → Tj: Ti is waiting for a resource held by Tj
- **If a cycle exists → Deadlock**

</div>

```text
  Resource-Allocation Graph → Wait-for Graph

  Ti → Rq → Tj  is converted to  Ti → Tj
```

Cycle detection: O(n^2) (n = number of threads)

---

# Wait-for Graph — Example

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

Converting from a Resource-Allocation Graph to a Wait-for Graph:

</div>

```text
  Resource-Allocation Graph:          Wait-for Graph:

    (T1)──→[R1]──→(T2)                (T1)──→(T2)
             ↑                                  │
    (T5)──→[R3]──→(T3)                (T5)──→(T3)

              └──→(T4)                      (T4)

  Cycle in Wait-for Graph:
    T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T1  → Deadlock!
```

# Detection — Multiple Instances

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

When each resource type has multiple instances:

**Similar** to Banker's Algorithm but with a key difference:

| | Banker's (Avoidance) | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Matrix used | **Max** (maximum demand) | **Request** (current requests) |
| Finish initialization | All false | True if Allocation_i == 0 |
| Judgment criteria | Safe/Unsafe | Deadlocked/Not |
| Purpose | Prevent future deadlock | Diagnose current state |

</div>

---

# Detection Algorithm — Details

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

</div>

```text
1. Work[m] = Available
   Finish[i] = false (if Allocation_i != 0)
   Finish[i] = true  (if Allocation_i == 0)

2. Find i such that Finish[i] == false and Request_i <= Work
   If no such i exists, go to step 4

3. Work = Work + Allocation_i
   Finish[i] = true
   Go back to step 2

4. If Finish[i] == false for some thread Ti
   → Ti is deadlocked

   If all Finish[i] == true
   → No deadlock
```

**Optimistic assumption**: If a request is fulfilled, the thread will soon complete and return its resources

# Detection Algorithm — Example (No Deadlock)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

5 threads, 3 resource types: A(7), B(2), C(6)

```text
Step 1: Select T0 (Request(0,0,0) <= Work(0,0,0))
  Work = (0,0,0)+(0,1,0) = (0,1,0), Finish[0]=T

Step 2: Select T2 (Request(0,0,0) <= Work(0,1,0))
  Work = (0,1,0)+(3,0,3) = (3,1,3), Finish[2]=T

Step 3: Select T3 (Request(1,0,0) <= Work(3,1,3))
  Work = (3,1,3)+(2,1,1) = (5,2,4), Finish[3]=T

Step 4: Select T1 (Request(2,0,2) <= Work(5,2,4))
  Work = (5,2,4)+(2,0,0) = (7,2,4), Finish[1]=T

Step 5: Select T4 (Request(0,0,2) <= Work(7,2,4))
  Work = (7,2,4)+(0,0,2) = (7,2,6), Finish[4]=T

All Finish = true → No Deadlock!
Sequence: <T0, T2, T3, T1, T4>
```

# Detection Algorithm — Example (Deadlock)

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

From the previous state, T2 additionally requests 1 instance of C:

</div>

```text
         Allocation    Request     Available
         A  B  C      A  B  C     A  B  C

  T3     2  1  1      1  0  0
  T4     0  0  2      0  0  2

```text
Step 1: Select T0 (Request(0,0,0) <= Work(0,0,0))
  Work = (0,1,0), Finish[0]=T

Step 2: Search remaining threads for Request <= Work:
  T1: Request(2,0,2) <= (0,1,0)? No (2>0)
  T2: Request(0,0,1) <= (0,1,0)? No (1>0)
  T3: Request(1,0,0) <= (0,1,0)? No (1>0)
  T4: Request(0,0,2) <= (0,1,0)? No (2>0)

  → No further progress possible!

Finish = [T, F, F, F, F]
→ T1, T2, T3, T4 are Deadlocked!
```

# Detection Algorithm Invocation Frequency

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**When should the detection algorithm be invoked?**

Factors to consider:
1. How often does deadlock occur?
2. How many threads are affected by a deadlock?

**Strategies:**
- **On every request**: Immediate detection, can identify the causing thread, but high overhead
- **Periodically**: At fixed intervals (e.g., every hour)
- **Based on CPU utilization**: Invoke when CPU utilization drops below 40%
  - Deadlock reduces system throughput and lowers CPU utilization

</div>

---

# Deadlock Management in Databases

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**Deadlock management in database systems:**

- Deadlock can occur since locks are used during transaction processing
- Periodically search for cycles in the wait-for graph
- When deadlock is detected:
  1. **Select victim** — Choose the transaction with minimum cost
  2. **Abort transaction** — Roll back the victim's work
  3. **Release locks** — Return locks held by the victim
  4. **Continue remaining transactions** — Resolve the deadlock
  5. **Re-execute victim** — Restart the aborted transaction

MySQL selects the transaction with the fewest insert/update/delete rows as the victim

</div>

# Part 7
## Recovery from Deadlock

---

# Recovery — Process Termination

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Recovery action is needed when deadlock is detected

**Method 1: Terminate all** — Terminate **all** deadlocked processes
- Guaranteed resolution but expensive (discards long-running computations)

**Method 2: Terminate one at a time** — Terminate one at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated
- Requires re-running the detection algorithm each time → overhead
- Which process to terminate? (victim selection)

</div>

---

# Victim Selection Criteria

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

Which process should be terminated (aborted) first?

Factors to consider:

1. **Priority** — Lower priority processes first
2. **Execution time** — How long has it been running, how much remains until completion
3. **Resources used** — Number and type of held resources (easy to preempt?)
4. **Resources needed** — Number of additional resources needed to complete
5. **Impact scope** — Number of processes affected by termination

</div>

---

# Recovery — Resource Preemption

<div class="text-left text-lg leading-10">

**Forcibly reclaim resources** from deadlocked processes

3 considerations:

</div>

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

**1. Selecting a victim**
- Reclaim resources from the process with minimum cost
- Use number of held resources, execution time, etc. as cost factors

**2. Rollback**
- Roll back the preempted process to a safe state
- Simple method: Total rollback (abort and restart)
- Advanced method: Roll back only as far as needed (requires checkpoints)

**3. Starvation prevention**
- Prevent the same process from being repeatedly selected as victim
- Include **rollback count in the cost factor** — cost increases with each rollback

</div>

---

# Comparison of Recovery Methods

<div class="text-left text-base leading-8">

| Method | Description | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Terminate all | Kill all deadlocked processes | Guaranteed resolution | Expensive, computation loss |
| Terminate one at a time | Kill one by one until cycle breaks | Minimum cost possible | Requires repeated detection |
| Resource Preemption | Forcibly reclaim resources | Process preservation possible | Complex rollback, starvation risk |

</div>

**Real system approaches:**
- Database: Transaction abort and rollback (natural recovery mechanism)
- OS: Mostly ignorance (manual reboot) or application-level handling
